In order to survive in the competition, companies continue to improve their products and service, and as a result, the whole society prospers. However, when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation, what we are concerned about is not the whole society, but the development of an individual's whole life. From this point of view, I firmly believe that we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education.
 First of all, through cooperation, children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students. What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly, how to get along with others. During the process of cooperation, children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others, how to communicate with others, how to think comprehensively, and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred. All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life.
 On the other hand, the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory. Hence it is always said that competition makes the society more effective. However, when we consider about the question that how to win the game, we always find that we need the cooperation. The greater our goal is, the more competition we need. Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance, it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach, and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet, and those who are in charge of the medical care. The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team. Therefore without the cooperation, there would be no victory of competition.
 Consequently, no matter from the view of individual development or the relationship between competition and cooperation we can receive the same conclusion that a more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one's success.";"The question of whether students should be taught to compete or to cooperate is one that has been debated for many years. On one hand, competition can be seen as a positive force that encourages students to strive for excellence and to push themselves to reach their full potential. On the other hand, cooperation can be seen as a way to foster collaboration, teamwork, and problem-solving skills. Ultimately, the answer to this question depends on the individual student and the context in which they are learning.
 
 When it comes to competition, it is important to recognize that it can be a powerful motivator for students. Competition can help to create a sense of urgency and drive that encourages students to work hard and strive for excellence. It can also help to foster a sense of pride and accomplishment when students are able to achieve success. However, it is important to recognize that competition can also lead to unhealthy levels of stress and anxiety, as well as feelings of inadequacy and failure.
 
 Cooperation, on the other hand, can be a great way to foster collaboration and teamwork among students. It can help to create an environment of mutual respect and understanding, as well as a sense of shared responsibility. Cooperation can also help to develop problem-solving skills, as students must work together to come up with creative solutions to challenges. However, it is important to recognize that cooperation can also lead to a lack of individual accountability, as students may become too reliant on each other and not take responsibility for their own learning.
 
 Ultimately, the decision of whether to teach students to compete or to cooperate should be based on the individual student and the context in which they are learning. For some students, competition may be the best way to motivate them and help them reach their full potential. For others, cooperation may be the best way to foster collaboration and problem-solving skills. Ultimately, it is important to recognize that both competition and cooperation can be beneficial in different contexts, and it is up to the teacher to decide which approach is best for their students.";"In a society where competition is sometimes seen as the only way to succeed, it can be difficult to navigate the balance between healthy competition and cooperation. There are many arguments for and against teaching students to compete or to cooperate, but it is ultimately up to the educators and parents to decide which approach will best prepare children for the future. 
 
 Proponents of teaching students to compete argue that competition is a necessary skill in todays world, as it prepares students for a more demanding workforce. They argue that competition encourages students to strive for excellence, as it provides an incentive to strive for the highest possible results in order to be the best. Furthermore, competition can foster motivation and self-discipline, as students are encouraged to work hard in order to keep up with their peers. 
 
 On the other hand, those who advocate for teaching students to cooperate believe that this approach has many benefits that competition does not offer. Cooperation not only encourages collaboration, it also fosters a sense of community, as students must work together to solve a problem or accomplish a task. Additionally, cooperation teaches students to think critically and to respect the ideas of others, as they must work together to achieve a shared goal. Cooperation can also teach students respect, as they must value the perspectives and contributions of others. 
 
 Ultimately, when it comes to deciding whether students should be taught to compete or to cooperate, educators and parents must take into account the needs of the individual students, as each student has different learning needs and abilities. In order to prepare students for the future, it is important to create a balance between healthy competition and cooperation, as both approaches can teach valuable skills and both have their strengths and weaknesses. Educators should strive to create a learning environment that encourages students to strive for excellence and succeed, while also fostering respect and collaboration.";53;2180;2172;2059;2115.5
1;1;essay02.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/essay-more-people-migrating-other-countries-than-ever-before-53351/;More people are migrating to other countries than ever before;"The last 50 years have seen an increasing number of immigrants to other countries. People moved due to a number of reasons, namely better educations or higher salary jobs. Some people thought that they should follow the local customs in order to integrate into their adopted countries’ cultures. However I strongly believe that they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values.
 Firstly, maintaining one’s cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments. Take Australia for example, immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues. Many Australians come this day to enjoy the shows, learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values. These feedbacks, in turn, help raise one’s pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more. Thus this makes it clear that sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential.
 Secondly, it is crucial to keep one’s identity for they need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin. For instance, children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends. In this new environment, parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home. Fail to create this familiarity makes them felt isolated, in the extreme can lead to social disorder like autism. Hence, it is clear that keeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is tremendous important.
 To conclude, although there are opposing ideas of neglecting one’s cultural values to adapt in the new cultures. As far as I am concerned, sustaining the traditions will make the immigrated people keep their cultural identity and give them confident among the many culture society.";"In recent years, the number of people migrating to other countries has increased significantly. This phenomenon has been driven by a variety of factors, including economic opportunity, political instability, and the search for a better quality of life. As a result, more people are migrating to other countries than ever before.
 
 The primary driver of this trend is economic opportunity. Many people are drawn to countries with strong economies and job opportunities, as they offer the potential for a better quality of life. This is especially true in developing countries, where the gap between the rich and the poor is often very large. People from these countries often migrate to more developed countries in search of better wages and job prospects.
 
 Political instability is another factor driving people to migrate. In many countries, political unrest and violence have created an environment of fear and insecurity. People are often forced to flee their homes in search of safety and stability. This is especially true in countries with oppressive regimes, where people are often persecuted for their beliefs or ethnicity.
 
 Finally, people are also drawn to other countries in search of a better quality of life. This includes access to better healthcare, education, and other amenities. In some cases, people may also be seeking a more relaxed lifestyle or a different cultural experience.
 
 Overall, more people are migrating to other countries than ever before. This trend is driven by a variety of factors, including economic opportunity, political instability, and the search for a better quality of life. As a result, countries around the world are experiencing an influx of migrants, which has both positive and negative implications. It is important to recognize the complexity of this issue and to develop policies that address the needs of both migrants and host countries.";"In recent years, the number of people who choose to migrate to another country has been increasing at an unprecedented rate. As the globalized world continues to become more interconnected and accessible, more and more people are opting to pursue new lives away from their country of origin. This startling trend has been fueled by a variety of factors.
 
 The economic opportunities that many other countries offer seem to be a primary motivator for many people. We are living in an age of increased economic inequality, and a lot of people are seeking more prosperous and stable futures for themselves and their families. This type of economic migration is most often seen in countries where there is either a lack of job opportunities or significant wage gaps. People are hoping to find countries with better pay, better quality of life, and better access to services and amenities.
 
 Political and societal instability is another key factor in the increased rate of emigration. Countries with unstable governments and human rights abuses, or where economies are struggling or on the brink of collapse, often cause people to migrate in search of safer and more secure lives. In addition, people often feel that their fundamental rights to religious freedom and expression are not adequately met in their home countries, and they search for countries with better protection of these basic rights.
 
 Finally, people are choosing to migrate for the cultural and educational opportunities that are available in other countries. Many people seek to branch out and gain access to new experiences and knowledge, and to extend their education abroad at prestigious foreign universities. This type of migration also often allows for people to interact with different cultures, build new relationships, and create networks that can benefit them in the future.
 
 For better or worse, more people are migrating to other countries than ever before. Although the primary factors driving this trend are economic, political, and educational opportunities, ultimately, people are willing to leave their homes and search for new lives in other countries in order to try to build better and brighter futures for themselves and their families.";61;2018;1898;2229;2063.5
2;2;essay03.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/essay-international-tourism-now-more-common-than-ever-before-53202/;International tourism is now more common than ever before (for);"The last decade has seen an increasing number of tourists travelling to visit natural wonder sights, ancient heritages and different cultures around the world. While some people might think that this international tourism has negative effects on the destination countries, I would contend that it has contributed to the economic development as well as preserved the culture and environment of the tourist destinations. 
 Firstly, international tourism promotes many aspects of the destination country’s economy in order to serve various demands of tourists. Take Cambodia for example, a large number of visitors coming to visit the Angkowat ancient temple need services like restaurants, hotels, souvenir shops and other stores. These demands trigger related business in the surrounding settings which in turn create many jobs for local people improve infrastructure and living standard. Therefore tourism has clearly improved lives in the tourist country.
 Secondly, through tourism industry, many cultural values have been preserved and natural environments have been protected. For instance, in Vietnam, many cultural costumes and natural scenes, namely ‘Trong Dong’ drum performance and ‘Ha Long’ bay, are being encouraged to preserve and funded by the tourism ministry. Without this support and profit from tourism, many traditional cultures would disappear due to its low income works. Thus, tourism has survived many non-tangible cultural values and beauty scenes. 
 To conclude, as far as I am concerned, international tourism has both triggered economic development and maintained cultural and environment values of the tourist countries. In addition, the authorities should adequately support these sustainable developments.";"International tourism is now more common than ever before, and this is a positive development for both travelers and the countries they visit. With the advent of the internet and the growth of the global economy, it has become easier than ever for people to travel to different countries and experience different cultures. This has opened up a world of opportunities for travelers, allowing them to explore new places, experience different cultures, and learn about different ways of life.
 
 At the same time, international tourism has had a positive impact on the countries that travelers visit. Tourism can bring in much-needed revenue to countries that are struggling economically, as well as providing jobs for local people. It can also help to promote cultural understanding and appreciation between different countries, as travelers learn about different cultures and customs. This can help to foster better relations between countries, and can even lead to increased trade and investment.
 
 International tourism can also help to protect the environment. By encouraging travelers to visit different countries, it can help to reduce the amount of pollution caused by air travel, as well as helping to reduce the amount of resources used in the production of goods and services. This can help to reduce the amount of waste and pollution that is produced, and can help to preserve the natural environment of the countries that are visited.
 
 Overall, international tourism is now more common than ever before, and this is a positive development for both travelers and the countries they visit. It can bring in much-needed revenue, promote cultural understanding, and help to protect the environment. For these reasons, international tourism should be encouraged and supported.";"International tourism has seen a massive boom in the last decade or so, with many countries experiencing a surge in the number of foreign tourists visiting each year. The advantages of international tourism are manifold, ranging from economic benefits to cultural exchange. For some nations, international tourism has become an integral pillar of their economy, and for many, it offers a unique opportunity to learn about the world.
 
 On one hand, international travel offers a chance for many to experience new cultures and to learn about the customs and practices of different countries. This provides a unique opportunity for people to experience rich and varied cultures, as well as to appreciate the beauty of the worlds many natural wonders. In addition, international tourism enables individuals to form meaningful connections and relationships with people from all over the globe, which can be rewarding and educational. 
 
 From an economic standpoint, international tourism is incredibly advantageous. It can lead to a significant boost in the countrys economy, as tourism generates a tremendous amount of revenue. This income helps to create jobs, improve infrastructure and encourages foreign investment. Furthermore, international tourism increases the visibility of a country, which can ultimately help to improve its reputation around the world.
 
 Furthermore, international tourism can help to bridge the gap between countries and cultures. By bringing people from diverse backgrounds together, it can lead to increased tolerance and understanding between different cultures, as well as promoting peace and harmony.
 
 Finally, international tourism helps to showcase the unique beauty and wonders of each respective country. In todays increasingly connected world, international tourists can help to spread the word and to attract more tourists to a country, leading to even more economic benefits and advertising potential.
 
 In conclusion, international tourism has become increasingly common in recent years and it offers a wide range of advantages, from economic benefits and cultural exchange, to fostering relationships and promoting peace and harmony between different countries. With the help of international tourists, countries can showcase their unique beauty and benefit from the numerous economic advantages associated with tourism.";63;1734;1783;2365;2074.0
3;3;essay04.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/essay-international-tourism-now-more-common-than-ever-before-53202/;International tourism is now more common than ever before (against);"The last 50 years have seen a significant increase in the number of tourist travelling worldwide. While some might think the tourism bring large profit for the destination countries, I would contend that this industry has affected the cultural attributes and damaged the natural environment of the tourist destinations.
 Firstly, it is an undeniable fact that tourists from different cultures will probably cause changes to the cultural identity of the tourist destinations. Take Thailand for example, in the Vietnam War, many American soldiers came to Thailand for a break and involved in sexual and drug activities, these huge demands caused many local businesses opened and expanded, even illegally involved in under-age prostitutes to maximise their profits. This was due to the lack of adequate controls by authorities and lead to a bad image of Thailand tourism. Therefore this proves that international tourism can create negative impacts on the destination countries.
 Secondly, there are clear evidences that tourism increasingly create harms to the natural habitats of the destination appeals. As the Australia’s Great Barrier Reef has shown, the billion visitors per annum has generated immense destruction to this nature wonder, namely breaking the corals caused by walking or throwing boat’s anchors, dropping fuel and other sorts of pollutions. For this reason, many marine lives have been endangered, in the extremes part of the reef become uninhabitable for these marine species. Thus, it is apparent that tourism has threatened the nature environments.
 To conclude, I strongly believe that the tourism has created threatening pressure on both the sociocultural and natural environments. If authorities do not take steps to appropriately conserve these precious values, they will be destroyed in the near future.";"International tourism has become increasingly popular in recent years, with more and more people travelling abroad to explore different cultures and experiences. While this can be seen as a positive development, there are also some negative aspects to this trend. This essay will argue that international tourism is now more common than ever before, but that this is not necessarily a good thing.
 
 The main benefit of international tourism is that it allows people to experience different cultures and gain a better understanding of the world. Travelling abroad can be a great way to learn about different customs and beliefs, and can help to foster greater understanding and tolerance between different countries. However, this benefit is often outweighed by the negative impacts of international tourism.
 
 One of the most significant negative impacts of international tourism is the environmental damage it can cause. Tourists often leave behind a large carbon footprint, as they travel long distances and use up resources such as water and electricity. This can have a detrimental effect on the environment, and can contribute to global warming. In addition, the influx of tourists to certain areas can lead to overcrowding, which can have a negative impact on local wildlife and ecosystems.
 
 Another issue with international tourism is that it can lead to a touristification of certain areas. This is when an area becomes so popular with tourists that it loses its original character and charm. This can lead to a decrease in the quality of life for local residents, as they are often priced out of the area due to the influx of tourists.
 
 Finally, international tourism can also lead to a brain drain in certain countries. This is when the best and brightest people leave their home countries to pursue better opportunities abroad. This can have a detrimental effect on the economy of the country, as it loses its most talented and educated citizens.
 
 In conclusion, while international tourism can be seen as a positive development, it is important to recognize the potential negative impacts it can have. It is clear that international tourism is now more common than ever before, but this is not necessarily a good thing. It is important to consider the potential negative impacts of international tourism, and to ensure that it is managed in a responsible and sustainable way.";"In recent times, international tourism has become increasingly popular and widespread, but this is not necessarily a good thing. Although this rise in global travel brings in economic benefits to many countries, there is also an array of issues associated with it, from environmental disruption to cultural erosion and more. All these factors should be taken into consideration when assessing the true cost of international tourism.
 
 The environmental impact of international tourism is significant and often irreversible. As more and more people travel to foreign countries, the emission of greenhouse gases rises and the global climate is affected. Many tourist spots have also seen a notable decrease in biodiversity as tourism activities contribute to habitat destruction and species loss. The pollution caused by high consumption of energy and water has also taken a toll on certain delicate ecosystems.
 
 Another problem with international tourism is its potential to disrupt and erode local cultures. Often, tourists expect to find certain comforts and conveniences that are common in their home countries but are not necessarily present in the destinations they are visiting. This can lead to local businesses and communities feeling forced to compromise their traditional ways of life in order to meet tourists demands. Tourists also bring their own cultural norms and expectations, which can clash with those of the locals.
 
 Finally, international tourism can also be exploitative in nature. Tour operators sometimes take advantage of their customers by selling them overpriced products and services of dubious quality. On the other hand, some tourist destinations have been known to exploit the local populations for their own financial gain. This often means low pay, long hours and dangerous working conditions for the locals, without any kind of social safety net.
 
 In conclusion, international tourism has become more popular than ever before, but it is not without its associated risks. We should not forget that there is a human as well as an environmental cost to this industry, and that these need to be taken into consideration when assessing its true value.";67;1829;2395;2185;2290.0

While some students study and live overseas to achieve this, some prefer to study home because of the difficulties of living and studying overseas. In my opinion, one who studies overseas will gain many skills throughout this experience for several reasons.
 First, studying at an overseas university gives individuals the opportunity to improve social skills by interacting and communicating with students from different origins and cultures. Compared to the peers studying in the home country, it will be more likely for the one who is living overseas to be successful in adapting himself/herself into new environments and situations in life.
 Second, living and studying overseas is an irreplaceable experience when it comes to learn standing on your own feet. One who is living overseas will of course struggle with loneliness, living away from family and friends but those difficulties will turn into valuable experiences in the following steps of life. Moreover, the one will learn living without depending on anyone else.
 Also, employers are mostly looking for people who have international and language skills. Becoming successful in this study will give the student an edge in job market. Therefore, one who has studied and lived overseas will become more eligible for the job than his/her peers.

 When living and studying overseas, it is important to be open-minded and willing to learn. It is also important to be patient and understanding of the culture and customs of the country. It is also important to be aware of the laws and regulations of the country, and to respect them.

Learning the language of the country can help to make the transition smoother, and can also help to build relationships with the locals. It is also important to learn about the culture and customs of the country, as this can help to make the experience more enjoyable.
 
 Living and studying overseas can also provide a unique perspective on life. It can provide an opportunity to learn about different cultures and customs, and to gain a better understanding of the world. It can also provide an opportunity to meet new people and make new friends.

On the one hand, it can give one the opportunity to experience a totally different culture, to learn a new language and to make friends from different parts of the world. On the other, there may be difficulties such as homesickness, adjusting to a new academic environment, and having to adapt to a lifestyle that is different from ones own.
 
 For those who choose to take up the challenge of living and studying overseas, it can be an incredibly rich and rewarding time.

Having to keep up with new systems and expectations can be overwhelming.

5;5;essay06.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/persuasive-essay-should-exercise-40115/;Why you should exercise;"More than 1.6 billion people in the world are either overweight or obese and United States has the highest rate of obesity. America's number one killer is cardiovascular diseases, which can easily be prevented by exercising. Exercise not only reduces the risk of health problems and various diseases, but it also has an effect on overall appearance. It is proven that exercising and being active can improve self-esteem and confidence. Excerising is one of the most important things in life and it can even be fun. It is a crucial element for living a healthier, longer, and happier life. 
 The number one reason why people should exercise is because it will keep you healthy. Americans are eating enormous amounts of fast foods these days, so cardiovascular diseases are becoming more and more common. One out of every four Americans are suffering from some form of cardiovascular diseases, which results in more than forty-five percent of deaths annually. The main cause for this condition is obesity. The more body fat that you have, the greater your risk for heart disease. However, this condition can easily be prevented or controlled by exercising. Exercising makes the heart muscles stronger. When your heart muscle is strong it can do the same amount of work at a lower heart rate, so the heart doesn't have to work as hard as it does with weak muscles. In today's society people are less concerned with the food they eat and their physical condition, so many serious illnesses are becoming quite common. Exercising not only helps prevent cardiovascular diseases, but it also helps prevent strokes, type 2 diabetes, and even certain types of cancer. 
 The second benefit to exercising is that it improves self-esteem and confidence. Most people think of exercising as only being a physical activity, but it's also a mental activity. There have been studies that show evidence that people who exercise have higher self esteem and confidence. It also showed that active people are less likely to have depression and anxiety. Exercising gives people energy, which helps people have positive outlooks on life and it helps relieves tension and stress. When you exercise you body releases endorphins, which are chemicals that create a happy feeling in brain. Plus, when you're exercising you're bringing more oxygen into you lungs and your brain appreciates the extra air. Exercising also helps improve you brain function and your memory.
 In my opinion the best reason to exercise is that it's really fun! Most people think that exercising takes up a lot of time and it requires too much work. When people actually take the time to try exercising they realize it's an enjoyable experience. It doesn't matter how you exercise, as long as you are being active. Everyone enjoys different sports or activities, so it's important to figure out which is best for you. When you having fun you don't even realize that your exercising and you look forward to it everyday. Setting goals and rewards will help you stay motivated and consistent with exercising.

Many people come up with plenty of excuses to not exercise; however, if you truly want to improve your mental and physical health you will find the energy and time to exercise.

6;6;essay07.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/essay-newspapers-soon-become-thing-past-6887/;Will newspapers become a thing of the past?;"The internet has been more and more popular for recent years, providing people with a huge source of information. As a result of this, print media such as newspapers have experienced a dramatic decline in the number of readers. Some people, however, still believe that they can exist for long time; others disagree, arguing that newspapers have lost their competitive advantage to sustain their prolonged existence. Personally, I am inclined to agree with the latter view for following reasons.
 First of all, to obtain information, using the internet is quicker and more convenient than reading newspapers. Contrary to the past when people had to wait long hours to take a daily newspaper, nowadays, they can acquire latest news updated every second through their mobile phones or computers connected to the internet, everywhere and at anytime. As can be seen, these devices and machines are very common in all parts of the world, making it easier for people to read a number of things that newspapers can not provide in only some pages. Hence, the print media has failed to keep its important role in the provision of information.
 Another point is that, from the economic aspect, buying newspapers appears to be a waste of money when the internet becomes available for every one. It is clear to recognize that the internet service is being provided at a low cost or even free in many countries. The question arises as to whether or not a person spends an extra money buying newspapers to receive the same, even usually less information than those he can have with the internet? The answer, perhaps, is that hardly would rational people do so. For this reason, the number of people reading newspapers may continue falling sharply, possibly leading to the close-downs of many in the coming time.
 Last, but not least, when taking environment into consideration, people must conceive that the more newspapers are published, the more trees are cut down. This is simply the contributor to the deforestation which is happening all over the world today. At this point, newspapers' production will have to face environmentalists on its way to be alive.
 In conclusion, it might be unpleasant for some advocating newspapers to witness the extinction of the type of media. However, this, if occurring, should be seen as a result of the ever- increasing innovations in media technology and in our modern life as a whole.
";"The newspaper industry has been in decline for decades, with the advent of digital media and the internet, and the question of whether newspapers will become a thing of the past is one that has been asked for some time. The answer to this question is not a simple one, as there are many factors that will determine the future of newspapers.
 
 On the one hand, it is clear that the newspaper industry is in decline. The rise of digital media has had a huge impact on the industry, with readers increasingly turning to online sources for news and information. This has led to a decrease in newspaper circulation and advertising revenue, which has had a significant impact on the industry. Additionally, the rise of social media has allowed for news to be shared quickly and easily, further reducing the need for traditional newspapers.
 
 On the other hand, there are still many people who rely on newspapers for their news and information. Many people still prefer to read a physical newspaper, and there are still many people who do not have access to the internet or digital media. Additionally, newspapers still provide a valuable source of information, with many newspapers providing in-depth coverage of local and national news.
 
 Ultimately, it is difficult to predict the future of newspapers. It is clear that the industry is in decline, but there are still many people who rely on newspapers for their news and information. It is likely that the industry will continue to decline, but it is also possible that newspapers will continue to exist in some form. Whether newspapers will become a thing of the past is ultimately up to the readers, and only time will tell what the future holds for the newspaper industry.";"In an era where technology advances at an unprecedented rate, it's no wonder questions arise regarding the future of print media. Specifically, will newspapers become a thing of the past? There is an argument to be made that newspapers no longer have the significance they once did due to the increased accessibility of digital news sources. However, there is also an argument to be made that the traditional newspaper still has an important role to play in the modern media landscape.
 
 On one hand, digital news sources have become heavily relied upon by many in today's technologically saturated society. Digital news sources are often more accessible, convenient, and up-to-date than traditional newspapers. In addition, digital news sources often provide features and reportage that traditional newspapers simply cannot, such as multimedia content and interactive features. As such, many readers have made the switch to digital news in order to stay current more quickly. For this reason, some contend that newspapers will soon become obsolete.
 
 On the other hand, others disagree with the assertion that newspapers are becoming a thing of the past. Despite the ubiquity of digital news sources, there is a still a loyal following for print media. Many still prefer to get their news from regularly printed newspapers, as it allows them to digest content at their own pace without the distraction of digital features. Moreover, many report feeling a greater sense of engagement when reading from a print newspaper compared to a digital source. As such, some suggest that newspapers are here to stay.
 
 Ultimately, whether or not newspapers will become a thing of the past is still up for debate. While digital news sources undoubtedly offer advantages, many still prefer the traditional printed version. As such, until a clear preference for one form or the other is established, debate over the future of newspapers will likely continue.";43;2413;1725;1947;1836.0
7;7;essay08.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/technology-cannot-solve-all-worlds-problems-53462/;Technology cannot solve all the world's problems;"In our modern times, with the development of science and technology, our living standard has been improved beyond recognition. Technology, however, is not the best solution to all the world's intricate problems. Accordingly, it is believed that we need to place less emphasis on technological solutions and more on other values, such as economy, politics and education. Personally, I partly disagree with this point of view, and the reasons are given below.
 To begin with, it should be borne in mind that technology plays an integral part in our lives. With the invention of computers and the Internet, we now can get easy access to all kinds of information. In addition, hi-tech devices also have a very positive impact on many aspects of our lives. They help us to work and study more efficiently, thus leading to an improvement in our abilities. Medical advances can improve our health and cure many fatal diseases. Besides, modern technology enables us to predict natural disasters much faster and more accurately, so we can reduce the number of deaths and property damage.
 However, there are some serious problems springing from modern technology. First, deadly and powerful weapons can be a huge threat to the world's peace. Second, a lot of people spend too much time using hi-tech devices nowadays. They abuse them so severely that they feel they can hardly live without them. This can have a detrimental effect on their health, since they are likely to develop many dangerous diseases, including obesity, heart attack and high blood-pressure.
 In conclusion, although there is no disputing the fact that technology is very crucial for our lives, in can also result in several negative drawbacks. However, I strongly believe that its advantages clearly outweigh its disadvantages, and that it can contribute greatly to the development of the world. Therefore, scientists should not place less emphasis on technological solutions, but try to pay more attention to develop new technologies instead.";"The world is facing a multitude of problems, from poverty and inequality to climate change and global pandemics. Technology has been a major force in helping to address these issues, from providing access to clean water and energy to developing treatments for diseases. However, technology alone cannot solve all of the worlds problems.
 
 Technology can be a powerful tool for improving the lives of people around the world, but it is not a panacea. Technology can help to reduce poverty and inequality by providing access to education, healthcare, and other basic services. It can also help to reduce the impact of climate change by providing renewable energy sources and helping to reduce emissions. However, technology cannot solve the underlying issues that cause poverty and inequality, such as unequal access to resources, lack of political representation, and systemic racism.
 
 Technology can also help to address global pandemics, such as the current COVID-19 crisis. Technology can help to track the spread of the virus, develop treatments, and provide access to healthcare. However, technology cannot solve the underlying issues that make pandemics more likely, such as overcrowding, lack of access to healthcare, and poor sanitation.
 
 Ultimately, technology can be a powerful tool for addressing the worlds problems, but it cannot solve them alone. To truly address the worlds problems, we must also focus on the underlying causes of poverty and inequality, climate change, and pandemics. This requires a combination of technological solutions, policy changes, and social action. Only by addressing the root causes of these issues can we hope to make lasting progress.";"The world today is in desperate need of solutions to the many problems it is facing, such as poverty, famine, illiteracy and environmental destruction. Technology has provided us with an easy, efficient and economical way to solve many of these issues. From creating new methods to produce food, to finding ways to alleviate poverty, and inventing ways to reduce pollution, technology has enabled us to address many of the worlds problems.
 
 However, it is important to remember that technology cannot solve all of the worlds problems. Even with all the advances that technology can bring, there are still many issues that cannot be resolved solely by technological means. These include problems related to social and political ideologies, such as racism and economic inequality. No matter how advanced or sophisticated our technology may be, it cannot completely solve these issues. People must be willing to create social, cultural and political changes to address these problems.
 
 In addition, some of the most pressing global issues cannot be solved without a deep understanding of the current global systems and how they work. This understanding is beyond the reach of most technological solutions. For example, in order to tackle issues such as climate change, world hunger and poverty, it is essential to have an understanding of economics and politics, and how nations interact with one another. This means that technological solutions alone cannot resolve these problems, but rather, a combination of technology, education and understanding are needed to achieve meaningful change.
 
 Overall, technology has the potential to provide solutions to many of the worlds problems, but it is important to remember that it is not a cure-all. For many of the worlds issues, technological solutions are only part of the solution. People must also be willing to make substantial changes to their societies, cultures and political systems in order to truly address these problems. Technology can be a powerful tool, but it is not a complete solution.";48;2006;1684;2051;1867.5
8;8;essay09.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/undergraduate-essays-2/marijuana-persuasive-essay-41857/;The Truth About Cannabis;"Is marijuana as bad as society makes it out to be? Since the 1930's marijuana has been illegal in the United States. That being said it's somehow America's number one cash crop. Users of the drug aren't the only ones who support cannabis; many of us who do not indulge are pro-legalization because we see that prohibition does more harm than good.
 The legalization of marijuana would help get the economy going again. Despite great efforts by the federal government against marijuana, it has become a large part of the national economy. Imagine if we were to legalize and tax it, the government would make tons of profit and we could start paying off this $16trillion national debt. Not to mention it would create tons of jobs and people in prison for marijuana crimes would be released. In a country with only 5% of the earth's population, the United States holds 25% of the world's prisoners (""Marijuana Prison Statistics""). A significant amount of those criminals are in there for drug related crimes.
 The war on drugs is a complete failure. It's done nothing but waste tax payer dollars, fill prisons with non violent criminals, and create a black market. The main reason cannabis remains illegal is because lobbyists are making tons of money off of prohibition. For example, Pharmaceutical companies lobby against cannabis because at a lower price, there are so many drugs (painkillers, sleep medication) it could replace. Another group that benefits greatly from prohibition are the drug cartels. Legalize marijuana and you cut a huge percent of their profits, army strength, and political power. Otherwise they're going to do whatever they can to save the marijuana black market.
 You could argue that marijuana is physically unhealthy for you and that's why it's illegal. But then you'd have to explain why alcohol and tobacco are legal because those substances are way more harmful than cannabis. 79,000 people a year die from alcohol poisoning, while zero people have died from overdosing on pot. People think that prohibition has kept marijuana out of children's hands. They think legalizing this drug would expose more children and teens to it. It's a whole lot easier for kids to obtain marijuana as opposed to alcohol or tobacco. A drug dealer doesn't check for ID like a cashier would. Teens are susceptible to harsher drugs after trying marijuana because they are introduced to these hardcore drugs in the same underground market where they got the marijuana, not because it's a gateway drug. Another thing that is often said is that marijuana is addictive and can be abused, thus making it mentally unhealthy. This is an unfair statement, anything has the potential to be abused, even something as simple as food. 
 You never hear about the positive effects marijuana can have on society. Many musicians admit that cannabis helps them get creative with their music and opens their minds to new ideas and concepts. Many cancer patients have used medical marijuana as a way of dealing with nausea after treatment or stimulating their appetite. The point is people have benefited from marijuana whether it was for medical or recreational purposes. Cannabis is classified as a schedule one drug, this suggests that it is as dangerous and addictive as heroin, meth, and even more dangerous than cocaine. Even if you believe that's accurate information, who are you to tell people what they can and can't put in their bodies? Expecting everyone to adapt to your beliefs or morals is extremely narrowed minded.
";"The Truth About Cannabis
 
 Cannabis has been a controversial topic for many years, with some people believing it to be a dangerous drug and others believing it to be a harmless plant. The truth is that cannabis is neither of these things, but rather a complex substance with both potential benefits and risks.
 
 Cannabis is a plant that contains a variety of compounds, including THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) and CBD (cannabidiol). THC is the main psychoactive component of cannabis and is responsible for the high that people experience when they consume it. CBD, on the other hand, is non-psychoactive and is believed to have potential therapeutic benefits.
 
 The potential benefits of cannabis include pain relief, anti-inflammatory effects, and anti-anxiety effects. It has also been studied for its potential to help with certain medical conditions, such as epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and cancer. However, it is important to note that the research on these potential benefits is still in its early stages and more research is needed to fully understand the effects of cannabis.
 
 At the same time, it is important to be aware of the potential risks of cannabis use. These include an increased risk of mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, as well as an increased risk of addiction. It is also important to note that cannabis can impair cognitive functioning and motor skills, and can be dangerous when combined with alcohol or other drugs.
 
 In conclusion, the truth about cannabis is that it is a complex substance with both potential benefits and risks. It is important to be aware of both when considering whether or not to use cannabis. It is also important to remember that more research is needed to fully understand the effects of cannabis.";"The Truth About Cannabis
 
 The legalization of cannabis has been a hotly debated topic in recent years. As such, it is essential to understand the truth about cannabis use and its effects. Cannabis is a natural plant with long-held medicinal benefits, but it can also be abused if not used responsibly. It has been used for centuries as a medicinal remedy, however, it is important to understand the associated risks and benefits of cannabis use.
 
 When it comes to the effects of cannabis, there are both risks and benefits associated with its use. The main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). This is the chemical compound that produces the high associated with cannabis use. THC directly affects the brain by improving mood, reducing anxiety and increasing feelings of relaxation. The short-term effects of cannabis are well documented, but the long-term effects are still largely unknown.
 
 On the medicinal side, cannabis has been used to treat a variety of ailments from chronic pain to seizures. There have been numerous studies that suggest cannabis can be beneficial in curbing symptoms of anxiety, depression, PTSD, chronic pain, and other medical conditions. In some cases, it has been found to be useful in helping reduce the number and severity of seizures in people living with epilepsy. It has also been used to reduce the symptoms of chemotherapy in cancer patients.
 
 However, the potential risks of cannabis should also be taken into consideration. Cannabis is associated with an increased risk of addiction, especially when used in high doses. Long-term use can also lead to cognitive impairment and memory problems. While cannabis use is not believed to cause permanent brain damage, it is important to understand the associated risks and practice responsible use.
 
 The truth about cannabis is that it is a powerful substance with both medicinal and recreational benefits, but it must be used responsibly. It is important to be aware of the associated risks and benefits of cannabis use and to understand the potential for misuse and abuse. Cannabis can be used safely and responsibly, and can offer many potential benefits.";24;3523;1776;2190;1983.0
9;9;essay10.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/persuasive-essay-same-sex-marriage-non-issue-essay-39280/;The Non-Issue of Same Sex Marriage;"There is not a single piece of history that determines whether or not same sex marriage is right or wrong. There is absolutely no legal, logical, or governing reason that same sex couples cannot be wed and it's extremely unconstitutional in every way to tell them they can't. Same sex marriage should be legal for a number of reasons, a few being, it's no one else's business if two men or two women want to get married, not allowing them to marry makes them seem inferior, and it rids them of their civil rights.
 In the book Gay marriage by Kate Burns, it states ""Who owns marriage? In other words, who defines marriage? Who allows marriage, and who enforces it?"" (22) It's wrong to tell two people who love each other that they cannot marry; it's nobody's business who you fall in love with. Just like it is no one's business to tell same sex couples they should not be able wed. Same sex couples just want the benefits of being married like everyone else and there is no proof saying that it is wrong for them to have those benefits. By not allowing them to marry all that America is doing is depriving same sex couples of their rights to care for each other and provide for each other. A common married couple gets benefits on health, gets to make decisions that are best for their spouse in extreme cases, and gets to inherit their spouse's belongings in death. 
 Making same sex marriage illegal also makes the people who are attracted to the same sex feel inferior. Nobody likes feeling inferior, or like they a below standards, by making sex marriage illegal you are making people who are attracted to the same sex feel and seem inferior to others. Homosexuality is not a conscious choice; it's something they are born with. Just like you didn't choose who you love, neither did they. So it's unfair to make same sex marriage seem inferior when it is no different. In the book Historical Guides to Controversial Issues in America Same-Sex Marriage by Allene Phy-Olsen it states ""Recent decades have seen much interest in the idea of diversity. The argument for same sex marriage asserts that it is hypocritical to deny the full rights and opportunities of citizenship which includes the access to an institution as basic as matrimony"" (76) You would never make a women feel inferior for being a women, so why should you make a man or a women feel like they are less just based on who they love. 
 Same sex marriage being illegal rids the couple of their civil rights. Civil rights are something people have worked hard to maintain over the years, abolishing slavery and treating women equally. Homosexual couples are no different. They deserve to have their civil rights fulfilled, just like women deserve to vote, they should be allowed to get married. Majority of the population against same sex marriage firmly believe the bible states that it is unholy for couples of the same gender to marry. Many people think that the word of the bible is comparable to law; however we have an amendment which protects our country from that exact situation. In the book The Constitution of the United States of America The Bicentennial keepsake edition, the first amendment provides that ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ...."" (51) The fact that it's in the bible should not dictate the laws against same sex couples becoming wed. Not allowing same sex couples to marry is like saying all people born with a certain hair color should not be allowed marry people of other hair colors, It makes no sense. Laws have been changed for all sexes, races' and genders for the same purpose, equal rights. It is hypocritical to not allow same sex marriage to occur when it appeals to a large growing group of people. 
 In the end same sex couples are really just couples and should be treated as such. They should be allowed the benefits of marriage, treated equally, not like they are inferior, and same sex couples should be allowed their civil rights. One day in the future this will be achieved.";"Same sex marriage has been a controversial topic for many years. It has been a hot button issue in the United States, with some states legalizing it and others banning it. However, the debate over same sex marriage is a non-issue.
 
 The main argument against same sex marriage is that it goes against traditional marriage. This is a valid argument, but it is also an outdated one. Traditional marriage has changed over the years, and same sex marriage is just another step in that evolution. It is no longer a radical concept, but rather an accepted part of modern society.
 
 Another argument against same sex marriage is that it is immoral. This is a subjective argument, and one that is not based in fact. There is no scientific evidence that same sex marriage is immoral, and it is not supported by any major religion. Therefore, it is not a valid argument against same sex marriage.
 
 The final argument against same sex marriage is that it will lead to the breakdown of society. This is an unfounded fear, as there is no evidence to suggest that same sex marriage will have any negative effects on society. In fact, studies have shown that same sex marriage can have a positive effect on society, as it can lead to greater acceptance and understanding of LGBT individuals.
 
 In conclusion, the debate over same sex marriage is a non-issue. It is an accepted part of modern society, and there is no evidence to suggest that it will have any negative effects on society. Therefore, it should be legalized in all states, and the debate should be put to rest.";"The debate over same-sex marriage has been ongoing for many years now and has become an increasingly divisive issue for most people in America. However, progress has been made, and its now legal nationally for two people of the same sex to get married. Thankfully, much of the heat from the debate has died down in recent years, and its now seen more as a non-issue.
 
 That being said, its easy to forget just how long it took to get to this point. Gay marriage was resisted by conservative politicians and religious organizations because of the fear that it would damage traditional values. They argued that allowing same-sex marriage would be a slippery slope to a breakdown in marriage and family values and falling apart of the moral fabric of society.
 
 Nothing could be further from the truth. Studies have been conducted that have found that legal same-sex marriage has had no negative impact on the values of society and has not had any effect on the health of heterosexual couples. In fact, same-sex marriage has been found to have a positive impact on marriage and family values, as it has increased levels of acceptance and understanding of same-sex couples and their families, as well as having a positive effect on mental health for members of the LGBTQ community.
 
 Overall, same sex marriage is no longer a contentious issue in most parts of the world and is seen as a non-issue. Most people recognize the right of individuals to marry the person of their choice, and there is increased understanding of the importance of marriage equality as a human right. Same-sex marriage is now over a decade old in America and is no longer seen as a revolutionary act. In the end, its just another form of love.";34;4065;1564;1718;1641.0
10;10;essay11.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/arguementative-persuasive-essay-camping-9834/;Everyone Should Go Camping;"Camping can take on many definitions. Camping to one person can mean seclusion in the middle of a forest. Another individual might think camping as a motor home with all the amenities of their house, including the kitchen sink. Whatever the definition is, camping is an experience that should be tried by everyone.
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has posted on their website, http://www.epa.gov/iaq/pubs/insidest.html, that approximately 90% of a person's life is spent indoors. The same article goes on to state ""In the last several years, a growing body of scientific evidence has indicated that the air within homes and other buildings can be more seriously polluted than the outdoor air in even the largest and most industrialized cities."" Spending time camping is a great way to revitalize the lungs. The phrase ""city air"" often is thought as air that is polluted, while ""country air"" is often used to describe clean, healthy air. Breathing the country air usually makes a person feel revitalized. There is no better way to receive the country air than while camping.
 Another great part about camping is being outside under the sun. The sun rays help the human body with the production of vitamin D. In fact, other than popping a vitamin pill, the only way that a body can produce vitamin D is through the exposure to the sun. Feeling the warm rays of the sun hit the face is always a welcome sensation. Being outside in the sun is another great advantage of camping.
 With the recent downturn of the economy, people are always trying to find ways to have fun at a relative inexpensive cost. Camping is a great way to have fun while keeping the overall cost down. A one night stay at Sands of Time RV Park costs twenty two dollars a night. That fee includes water, sewer, and electric. A stay in a condo in the same area will cost at least $645.00 for the week. A condo will cost the family $491 more than a campsite. That difference in price can make a camping trip a good possibility while keeping the overall costs down to a minimum.
 Camping gives anyone the possibility to go places that they have never been before. Camping can take you to Yosemite, or into the Band Lands of South Dakota. Camping can also take place at a nearby state park. No matter where the campsite is, a camper can feel miles away from the city. There are so many places both near and far that are best experienced by spending a few days within the place. Camping gives you the ability to see these beautiful locations at first sunlight, in the middle of the day, at sunset and even under the stars. It can be amazing how different the same object can look throughout the day.
 Campers often express how a feeling comes over their body when they reach the moment when the day to day turmoil leaves their body. Virtually every camper experiences this moment. This is specifically when they are experiencing nature and the realization is made how much simpler life is when outside with nature. Returning to nature often allows campers to return to their true selves. It is this discovery that should be experienced by all.
 The benefits of camping can also be seen in families. Some people that do not like the idea of camping give the reason of having to camp with people in such a confined space. It this confined space that, when allowed, can create a close bond between family members. When families go camping, they put the jobs and sporting events on hold. There are usually no video games being played, no soccer practice to drive to, and no business projects to worry about. By putting aside all of these events, the family has an opportunity to bond and renew their relationships. Some of this may be foreign to some people and there can be resistance. When this resistance is put aside, these bonds will be renewed. Camping is a great way to bring families together and strengthen their love.
 Food is always a item that people cannot do without. Campers have an opportunity to try some interesting food. Cooking over a fire makes burgers and potatoes taste better than can be found at any fast food place. Campers need to think out their meals thoroughly prior to making a trip. These well planned meals are sometimes the best meals that campers have ever had. Cooking a chicken over campfire, cooking an apple pie in a dutch oven, and cooking a burger wrapped in foil on the coals of a camp fire can put the best gourmet chefs to shame. Perhaps it is the fresh smoke, the clean air or just the fact that a camper's senses are heightened. Whatever the reasons are, food always tastes better when camping.
 Some of the people that can be met while camping can make the entire trip better. Campers can come from every state, and sometimes different countries. Taking a simple walk around the campsite, the camper can encounter these people and hear the most amazing stories. Campers are friendly and enjoy the company of fellow campers. Kids always seem to find new ""best friends"" for the weekends and even adults may find themselves sharing a meal with their new neighbors.
 Sometimes camping can also make campers realize the overlooked luxuries that they experience day to day. Flush toilets, warm showers, central heating and air, and even the lack of bugs accompanying the sleeping camper are some of the luxuries that are missed the most. A small weekend away from these luxuries can make the campers realize how lucky they are in their day to day living.
 Camping is one of the most basic and enjoyable activities that can be experienced by all. Camping has no requirements other than willing participants. Camping doesn't discriminate, doesn't have deadlines and has nothing but fun around each corner. No matter if the camping is experienced in a tent or in a luxury camper, getting outside, in the wilderness can provide a lifetime of memories. Camping has something for everyone.";"Camping is an activity that has been around for centuries, and it is still a popular activity today. It is a great way to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life and to enjoy nature. Everyone should go camping at least once in their lifetime because it is a great way to relax, connect with nature, and enjoy quality time with family and friends.
 
 Camping is a great way to relax and get away from the stress of everyday life. When camping, you can enjoy the peace and quiet of nature, away from the noise and distractions of the city. You can take a break from your daily routine and just enjoy the beauty of nature. Camping can be a great way to unwind and de-stress.
 
 Camping is also a great way to connect with nature. You can explore the outdoors and observe the wildlife, plants, and scenery. You can also learn about the environment and appreciate the beauty of nature. Camping is a great way to get in touch with the natural world and appreciate its beauty.
 
 Finally, camping is a great way to enjoy quality time with family and friends. You can spend time together, away from the distractions of everyday life. You can play games, tell stories, and just enjoy each others company. Camping is a great way to bond with family and friends and create lasting memories.
 
 In conclusion, everyone should go camping at least once in their lifetime. It is a great way to relax, connect with nature, and enjoy quality time with family and friends. Camping is an activity that has been around for centuries, and it is still a popular activity today. So, get out there and go camping!";"Camping is an excellent activity to be enjoyed by all ages. It is a great way to escape the hustle and bustle of city life, and to explore the great outdoors. It has many health benefits and there are many reasons why everyone should go camping at least once in their lifetime.
 
 One of the many benefits to camping is getting back to nature. With all the technology that is surrounding us in our day to day lives, it can be difficult to find moments of peace and tranquility. But when you go camping, you are able to unplug and experience nature up close. You can see the stars in the night sky, listen to the birds singing and observe the animals going about their day. Not to mention the fresh air, which can do wonders for both the mind and body.
 
 Another benefit of camping is its affordability. While it may not seem like it at the time, taking a camping trip is much cheaper than taking a vacation that involves airfare and hotels. All you need for an enjoyable camping trip is a tent and some camping gear, which can be easily acquired for a small price. Additionally, since camping locations are usually in more rural areas, most of the sites are free or have very minimal costs.
 
 Maybe most importantly, camping gives us the chance to disconnect from the world and reconnect with ourselves. When we are in nature, we can slow down, be present in the moment and give our mind a much-needed break from the stresses of work and everyday life. This can lead to improved mental clarity, which can help us to better manage our anxiety and stress levels. Additionally, the physical activity that comes with camping can help us to stay fit, while also giving us the chance to enjoy breathtaking views from the top of a mountain or cliffside.
 
 Finally, camping is a great way to spend quality time with family and friends. Sitting around the campfire and spending time together can be a great bonding experience for everyone. They will appreciate the time away from their phones and computers, and enjoy the ability to simply be in each others presence.
 
 In conclusion, camping is a great activity for individuals of all ages. It gives us the chance to get back to nature, increase our mental clarity, and spend quality time with family and friends. For these reasons and more, I believe that everyone should go camping at least once in their lifetime.";26;5892;1602;2362;1982.0
11;11;essay12.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/school-locker-check-persuasive-essay-1434/;Locker checks;"Why shouldn't schools do locker checks? Why do many students oppose locker checks? Random locker checks are not done to torment and/or invade the privacy of the students, but for many other important reasons which include school security. These checks are required because malicious students bring drugs and weapons to school and store them in the lockers. Random locker checks should be made obligatory and done frequently to assure the wellbeing of the students.
 In the first place, locker checks help increase the safety in schools. Safety is a problem in every environment and especially school. Drugs, alcohol, and firearms in lockers make a harmless place like school quite dangerous. School was known to be a secure environment for children where they could learn and have a have a fun time with friends. In the past 10 years that has all changed. The number of school shootings has increased significantly. Last year on April 16th the most deadly school shooting in U.S. history occurred. In this brutal massacre at Virginia Tech, 32 students were murdered and several more were wounded. To combat this growing epidemic, schools carry out repeated locker checks. 
 In the second place, locker checks keep students healthy. Locker checks help students stay both physically and mentally healthy because it discourages students from bringing fire arms and especially drugs. As everyone knows, drugs induce immense physical damage and when it is overdosed drugs can lead to death. As a result, drugs completely destroy a student's life. To prevent problems like this locker checks are required. Without the use of drugs, school security will increase dramatically. If the school is safe, students will no be frightened or strained.
 Lastly, more students will comply with the school policies because there are frequent locker checks and other students are getting caught and punished for it. The students who are yet to be caught will learn from the mistakes of other students and will stop. To increase the effect of locker checks, they should be done with security guards and dogs. Security guards at school increase security and security dogs help find drugs with their noses. School is a place to learn, not a place to bring malicious substances, electronics and etc. So, only learning material should be brought to school. With the continued discouraging of bringing drugs and weapons, a completely secure school will become an accomplishable goal.
 Locker checks should be made mandatory and done frequently because they assure security in schools, makes students healthy, and will make students obey school policies in the future. Students should	appreciate locker checks and other measures taken by the school to protect the school and the students. Privacy is a small price to pay for security against drugs and weapons. Like it or not, privacy will be invaded not only at school, so students have to accept it.";"Locker checks are a controversial topic in many schools. On one hand, they are seen as an invasion of privacy and a violation of students rights. On the other hand, they are seen as a necessary security measure to ensure the safety of students and staff.
 
 The primary argument in favor of locker checks is that they can help to prevent dangerous items from entering the school. By searching lockers, school administrators can identify any weapons, drugs, or other contraband that could be used to harm students or staff. This can help to create a safe learning environment and prevent potential tragedies.
 
 The primary argument against locker checks is that they are an invasion of privacy. Students have a right to privacy, and searching their lockers without their permission is seen as a violation of this right. Furthermore, locker checks can be seen as a form of discrimination, as certain students may be targeted for searches more than others.
 
 Ultimately, the decision to conduct locker checks should be made on a case-by-case basis. If a school has a history of violence or drug use, then locker checks may be necessary to ensure the safety of students and staff. However, if a school has a good record of safety, then locker checks may not be necessary.
 
 In conclusion, locker checks are a controversial topic, and the decision to conduct them should be made on a case-by-case basis. While they can be a useful security measure, they can also be seen as an invasion of privacy and a form of discrimination. Therefore, school administrators should carefully consider the pros and cons of locker checks before implementing them.";"Locker checks are a controversial topic as it relates to student safety within a school. On one hand, they can help ensure that dangerous or illegal items are not brought into a school, but on the other, they can be seen as an invasion of privacy. This essay will explore both sides of the debate and offer suggestions for a successful locker check policy. 
 
 The major argument in favor of locker checks is that they increase student safety. By having staff members go through the contents of students lockers, the school can ensure that weapons, drugs, alcohol, or other dangerous items are not brought into the school. This practice gives teachers, staff, and administrators peace of mind that the student body is safe from potential danger. Additionally, making locker checks a policy dissuades students from bringing such items onto school grounds in the first place, as the consequences for doing so are clear.
 
 On the other side of the debate, opponents of locker checks view them as an invasion of privacy. Locker checks involve rummaging through a students personal belongings, which can be seen as an unnecessary and intrusive measure. Additionally, students might be intimidated by the presence of administrators, or even fearful of consequences should items that are forbidden in school be found.
 
 Ultimately, if schools decide to implement locker checks, they should be done in a way that respects students and their privacy. Locker checks should be conducted by a staff member, such as a school resource officer, who the students are familiar with and trust. Procedures should be clearly communicated to the student body, and students should be given a chance to explain any items that are discovered. This can help ensure that students understand their rights and that locker checks are productive and not just an exercise in power.
 
 In conclusion, locker checks should not be viewed as a one size fits all solution for school safety. While they can help administrators find potentially dangerous items, they should be conducted in a respectful and equitable manner that acknowledges the students right to privacy. Ultimately, if locker checks are conducted with care and caution, they can be an effective tool for ensuring student safety throughout the school.";13;2925;1644;2283;1963.5
12;12;essay13.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/computers-replace-man-powr-jobs-3591/;Computer replace  man power in jobs;"With the current trend today of the ever-changing technology, it cannot be denied that several jobs are replaceable. On the other hand, there are still jobs which require the expertise of a human employee especially when it entails decision-making situations. 
 One example of a job that got replaced by the availability of technology or computer to the public is the reservation and ticketing officers of travel agencies and airlines. You can now see the availability of your intended travel dates online, make the reservation, know the price of the ticket you want to purchase and pay conveniently with your credit card and you're all done. You even have the choice of printing your own ticket or just pick it up at the airport at the day of your departure. But of course, there would still be several customers that prefer to talk with an agent in completing their purchase of a ticket. They may have several reasons to it but then maybe they are just comfortable dealing with a human being than a computer.
 Jobs that the most computer can do is assist, would be that of a medical doctor. It's true that technology and computers do make their jobs easier but it cannot definitely replace them. It can have less work for them, just for instance, instead of opening up a patient to get a gallstone, they would just use an instrument that would make a point incision and guide it through inside the body to do the job for them.
 With this, i still believe that technology and computers cannot eventually replace the workforce and drive employees to be jobless. We still need the personal touch of a human in each and everything that technology or computer could offer us.";"The debate over whether computers can replace man power in jobs has been ongoing for decades. On one hand, computers are seen as a tool that can help increase efficiency and accuracy in the workplace. On the other hand, some argue that computers cannot replace the human touch that is needed in certain jobs. This essay will explore both sides of the argument and ultimately conclude that computers can replace man power in certain jobs, but not all.
 
 The first argument in favor of computers replacing man power in jobs is that they can increase efficiency and accuracy. Computers are able to process large amounts of data quickly and accurately, which can help to reduce errors and save time. For example, in the medical field, computers can be used to quickly and accurately diagnose patients, which can save time and money. Additionally, computers can be used to automate certain tasks, such as data entry, which can free up employees to focus on more important tasks.
 
 The second argument against computers replacing man power in jobs is that certain jobs require the human touch. For example, in the customer service industry, computers cannot replace the empathy and understanding that a human customer service representative can provide. Additionally, certain jobs, such as teaching, require the ability to connect with and motivate students, which computers cannot do.
 
 Ultimately, computers can replace man power in certain jobs, but not all. Computers can increase efficiency and accuracy in certain tasks, such as data entry, and can be used to automate certain processes. However, certain jobs require the human touch, such as customer service and teaching. Therefore, it is important to consider the type of job when deciding whether or not to use computers to replace man power.";"It is a widely accepted belief that technology is rapidly replacing manual human labour in many areas of employment due to the numerous advantages that it brings. This essay will explore the advantages and disadvantages of replacing human power with computer power in jobs, with a particular focus on the positives and negatives of this development. 
 
 On the positive side, the use of computers in the workplace clearly brings many advantages. First of all, computers can work much faster than humans. This means that given the same task, a computer can complete it more quickly than a human, thereby increasing efficiency. Furthermore, computers do not get tired, meaning that they can work for longer periods of time than people and therefore are more cost effective. Additionally, computers are more accurate than humans, meaning that fewer mistakes are made and the end product is more reliable. 
 
 Despite these positives, there are some negatives associated with the use of computers in the workplace. One of the biggest issues is the cost of implementation. Computers are expensive to purchase and install, and they require regular maintenance and upgrades, which can be costly. Additionally, the use of computers can lead to a decrease in the number of jobs available. As computers are able to do the work of humans, the need for manual labour decreases and people can be made redundant. This can lead to a decrease in morale amongst those affected and can cause financial hardship. 
 
 In conclusion, although there are some downsides to replacing human power with computer power in jobs, on the whole the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. Computers are more reliable and cost effective, meaning that in the long run it can be beneficial for businesses to invest in them. Ultimately, it is important to remember that technology should not be used to completely replace human input, but rather to supplement it in order to increase efficiency and profitability.";35;1672;1799;1977;1888.0
13;13;essay14.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/essay-lessons-teachers-versus-others-sources-6343/;Lessons with teachers versus others sources;"Over the last half century the change in the life of human begings has increased beyond our wildest expectations. There are countless new technological equipments flooding into our lives, such as the Internet, television and cell phone. They all enrich our daily lives.Now, many students learn from Internet after class and they find it quite helpful.
 Many people find that students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers. They argue that teachers teach students how to write, read and calculate since they are in kindergarten.And when they are in primary school, teachers teach them more further knowledge, like writing skills and using computers.It is teachers that help them with obstacles in schooling. On the other hand, students gain most of the knowledge through teachers and learn what is right and wrong with the assistance of teachers.
 Those who feel that students learn far more from other sources, such as the Internet and television, frimly believe that within this sources students learn lots of things which they can't learn in classes. They can only input some key words and google it, and then there are numberless articles and websites related to it. In this case, stundents learn things easily. Moreover, they contend that good television programmes do teach students.For instance, Discovery Channel has many instructive episodes. Students have knowledge of others cultrues, outer space etc.
 Personally, I think that students learn far more from their teachers than from other source. Because not only do teachers teach us knowlegde but also the skills to tell right from wrong. Just imagine: if a student can't even make out whether the source is reasonable or not , then how can he get the right information to help him to learn?";"The education system has evolved significantly over the years, and with it, the way in which we learn. In the past, the primary source of knowledge was the teacher, but in today's world, there are a variety of sources from which we can gain knowledge. This essay will explore the differences between lessons with teachers and other sources, and how each can be beneficial in different ways.
 
 When learning from a teacher, the student is able to ask questions and receive direct feedback from the teacher. This allows the student to gain a deeper understanding of the material, as the teacher can explain concepts in greater detail and provide examples to help the student understand. Additionally, the teacher can provide guidance and support to the student, which can be beneficial in helping the student stay motivated and on track.
 
 On the other hand, learning from other sources can be beneficial in its own way. For example, online resources such as videos and articles can provide a wealth of information that can be accessed at any time. This allows the student to learn at their own pace and in their own way, which can be beneficial for those who learn better independently. Additionally, online resources can provide a more visual approach to learning, which can be helpful for those who learn better through visuals.
 
 Overall, both lessons with teachers and other sources can be beneficial in different ways. Lessons with teachers can provide direct feedback and guidance, while other sources can provide a more independent approach to learning. Ultimately, it is up to the student to decide which approach is best for them.";"Teachers can be an invaluable source of knowledge. They have a vast amount of experience, training and skills that can provide students with an understanding of their subject matter which may not be found in other sources. While other sources such as online tutorials, books and videos are useful, there are some benefits of learning from a teacher which make them irreplaceable. 
 
 One of the primary benefits of learning from a teacher is the individualized attention they can offer. Every student learns differently and unique learning needs can be addressed directly by a teacher. A teacher who is knowledgeable and competent in their field can explain concepts in a way that is tailored to the students understanding, and offer additional help when needed. For instance, a teacher can adapt their approach to target areas where the student may struggle, or provide additional resources or materials to enhance the learning process. 
 
 Another advantage of learning from a teacher is the immediate feedback they can provide. Through discussion and feedback, a teacher can provide personalized guidance and help the student to identify errors, strengths and weaknesses in their understanding. This is an invaluable learning tool as it can help to quickly identify and correct any misunderstandings before they become entrenched.
 
 Perhaps the most important advantage of learning from a teacher is the ability of a teacher to motivate and inspire their students. A teacher who is passionate and understands the importance of their subject matter can use their enthusiasm to show their students the value of learning. They can make a subject matter more applicable to the students life, encourage independent learning and stimulate further exploration of the topic.
 
 In conclusion, while other sources such as online tutorials, books and videos can provide students with valuable learning resources, there are some distinct advantages to learning from a teacher. Through individualized attention, immediate feedback and the ability to inspire, teachers can provide students with an incomparable learning experience.";43;1791;1641;2122;1881.5
14;14;essay15.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/writing-email-text-messaging-threats-written-language-6551/;Email and text messaging threats written language;"The introduction of email and text messaging has brought about considerable changes in communication. With this situation, some people believe that they may be factors decreasing the position of written language. I am in favor of that idea because of their advantages and the fact we can see today about the use of these new means.
 First of all, it is easy to point out many benefits users can get from email and text messaging, which answers to the question of their great popularity. Before email and mobile phone, human beings communicated by meeting directly, sending letters or later, calling from home phones. Such ways usually made people have troubles for the expensiveness, difficulties in far communication or emergency and the loss of information. However, email and cell phones have improved the obstacles above. People can send or receive electronic letters anywhere and anytime they want. Especially, thanks to the function provided by email and text messaging (SMS), it is cheaper and faster to transfer a lot of information, even to many people at the same time. They are so convenient that the majority of population prefer to use them instead of some traditional ways.
 The popularity of email and text messaging, as a result, leads to the losing of written language's position. People tend to use slangs and abbreviated words to shorten their writing and save more time in communicating for other activities. The outcome is that language in writing is not in its original form. Even in some cases, people compose a message with only emoticons (the expressions by face created by service providers), which means there is no room for writing or typing texts. Moreover, it is more dangerous that youngsters sometimes use such new languages in their studying, writing assignments. If that tendency continues at a rapid pace, written language may face up to a real problem about its stand.
 In conclusion, we cannot deny the threat from email and text messaging to the status of written language because their obvious popularity. Nevertheless, educators and individuals themselves, especially the youths should pay ore attention to this matter so that we can take advantages of the new language along with preserving the traditional one.";"Email and text messaging have become the primary means of communication in the modern world. While these technologies have made communication easier and more efficient, they have also created new threats to written language.
 
 The most obvious threat posed by email and text messaging is the potential for miscommunication. Without the benefit of facial expressions, body language, and other nonverbal cues, it can be difficult to accurately interpret the tone of a message. This can lead to misunderstandings and hurt feelings. Additionally, the lack of context in a text message or email can lead to confusion. For example, a joke may not be understood or taken the wrong way.
 
 Another threat posed by email and text messaging is the potential for abuse. Cyberbullying is a growing problem, and it is often done through email or text messaging. People can send hurtful messages without fear of repercussions, and the anonymity of the internet can make it difficult to identify the perpetrator.
 
 Finally, email and text messaging can lead to a decrease in the quality of written language. People often use abbreviations, slang, and emoticons in their messages, which can lead to a decrease in the quality of written language. Additionally, people may be less likely to take the time to proofread their messages, leading to more errors.
 
 In conclusion, email and text messaging can be a great way to communicate, but they also pose threats to written language. Miscommunication, abuse, and a decrease in the quality of written language are all potential issues that can arise from the use of these technologies. It is important to be aware of these threats and to take steps to minimize them.";"Email and text message threats have become an increasingly popular means of communication in modern society. With the ability to communicate instantaneously and across large distances, these communication channels provide both individuals and organizations with the ability to threaten or incite fear by sending anonymous messages that are difficult to trace or repudiate. As the prevalence of these threats increases, the need to understand their implications and the measures that should be taken to minimise their effects is becoming increasingly apparent.
 
 The issue of email and text message threats is significant in terms of the potential for harm that can be caused by sending these types of messages. As these communication channels allow for communication to be sent to multiple recipients, the potential for widespread fear and disruption can be significant. In addition, these threats can also lead to criminal activity as an individual who sends a threat may do so in an effort to extort money or other items of value.
 
 Given the serious nature of email and text message threats, it is important to take steps to protect yourself and others from them. In the case of individuals, this may involve implementing measures such as not providing personal contact details over the internet, framing appropriate responses to any threats received, and seeking help from the police if appropriate. In the case of organisations, it may involve training staff in how to recognise and respond to such threats, as well as developing policies and procedures to discourage the sending of such messages.
 
 Ultimately, it is important to take email and text message threats seriously. While it is sometimes difficult to recognise the potential danger of these messages, taking appropriate precautions can help to protect individuals and organisations from the danger posed by these types of messages. By understanding the implications associated with sending these types of messages and taking steps to reduce the potential for harm, those affected by such threats can ensure that the potential for damage is minimised.";49;2252;1699;2120;1909.5
15;15;essay16.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/research-papers-11/essay-useing-animals-benefit-human-beings-6746/;Using animals for the benefit of the human beings;"With the rapid development of the standard of people's life, increasing numbers of animal experiments are done, new medicines and foods, for instance. Some opponents says that it is cruel to animals and nature, however, I believe that no sensible person will deny that it is a dramatically cruel activity to humanity if the latest foods or medicines are allowed to sold without testing on animals. In my essay, I will discuss this issue from twofold aspects.
 First of all, as we all know, animals are friendly and vital for people, because if there are no animals in the world, the balance of nature will broke down, and we, human, will die out as well. The animal experiments accelerate the vanishing of some categories of animals. In other words, doing this various testing is a hazard of human's future and next generation.
 Though animal experiments have negative impact on the natural balance, it is necessary to make sure that people can live a long life. To begin with, it is indisputable that every new kind food or pill may be noxious, and scientists must do something to insure that the new invention benefits people instead of making people ill or even dying. The new foods or medicines are invented to promote the quantity of human's life. Thus even if they are volunteers; they cannot take the place of animals to test the new foods or medicines. Furthermore, it also have potentially harm for human's health without any testing. 
 To sum up, I reaffirm that although there is some disadvantages of animals' profits, the merits of animal experiments still outweigh the demerits.";"The use of animals for the benefit of human beings has been a controversial topic for many years. While some people believe that animals should not be used for any purpose, others argue that animals can be used in a humane and ethical way to benefit humans.
 
 The use of animals for medical research is one of the most common ways in which animals are used for the benefit of humans. Animal testing is used to develop new medicines and treatments for diseases, as well as to test the safety of products such as cosmetics and food additives. Animal testing is also used to study the effects of environmental pollutants on human health. While animal testing can be controversial, it is often the only way to gain the necessary information to develop new treatments and medicines.
 
 Animals are also used in agriculture to provide food for humans. Livestock such as cows, chickens, and pigs are raised for their meat, milk, and eggs. These animals are also used to produce other products such as leather and wool. While some people may argue that the use of animals for food production is cruel, it is necessary to provide food for the growing human population.
 
 Animals are also used in entertainment. Animals such as horses, dogs, and dolphins are used in shows and competitions. While some people may argue that this is cruel, animals can be trained to perform tricks and stunts that are entertaining for humans.
 
 Animals can also be used for therapy. Animals such as dogs and cats can be used to provide comfort and companionship to people who are ill or elderly. Animals can also be used to help people with disabilities, such as those with autism or physical disabilities.
 
 In conclusion, animals can be used for the benefit of humans in a humane and ethical way. Animal testing is necessary to develop new medicines and treatments, and animals are also used in agriculture, entertainment, and therapy. While some people may argue that the use of animals for these purposes is cruel, it is often necessary to provide food, entertainment, and comfort to humans.";"Animals have been an integral part of human life since the dawn of time. They have been part of our food chain, providing sustenance and transportation, as well as providing companionship, comfort, and entertainment. As mankind has advanced, so have our relationships with animals. Now, animals are being used for medical, military, and research purposes. This essay will explore the ethical implications of using animals for the benefit of human beings.
 
 The first question that arises when discussing the use of animals by humans is whether or not it is ethical to use animals for our benefit. While some people believe that it is unethical to use animals in any way, others believe that animals are a necessary part of human progress. One argument in favor of using animals for human benefit is that animals can be used to develop treatments for a variety of illnesses and injuries. For example, research on animal models has led to the development of successful treatments for human diseases such as cancer and AIDS. Additionally, animal testing has helped to create safer drugs and medical products that would not be available without animal testing.
 
 Furthermore, some medical procedures that involve animals have been found to be lifesaving for humans. For instance, organ transplants from animals, such as pig hearts, have been used to save the lives of humans in desperate need of a transplant. Additionally, animals provide invaluable services for the military, such as providing transportation, search and rescue services, and tracking enemy forces.
 
 Despite the potential benefits of using animals for human benefit, there are also ethical concerns that must be taken into account. Animals have been known to suffer inhumane conditions in medical testing and when used for military operations. Additionally, some argue that animals have the right to exist without being used as tools by humans. Furthermore, there are also environmental concerns that must be taken into account, including the risk of cross-species diseases and the destruction of habitats caused by animal experiments.
 
 In conclusion, animals have been an invaluable part of human existence since the dawn of time, and they can continue to be beneficial when used with respect and ethical consideration. While there are potential benefits to using animals for human benefit, there are also ethical concerns that must be taken into account. Ultimately, it is up to us to ensure that animals are treated humanely and that their habitats are protected.";49;1592;2071;2536;2303.5
16;16;essay17.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/should-rich-countries-help-poor-countries-51532/;Should rich countries help poor countries?;"Nowadays, the world includes developing countries and developed countries. The difference between them is amount of money that governments use in critical areas such as commerce, health, education. The poor countries are buried in debts which are caused by loans they borrowed from The World Bank and the rich countries. To ease this difference and help the less fortune countries, the richer countries should take efforts in improving important areas in the less fortune countries. 
 Most of the people in African and poor countries live in difficult conditions because of their countries locate in areas where lack of natural resources and have bad weather conditions for development as well. In these countries, citizens are in need for foods, corrupt and unemployment rate is at high level, the consequences of AIDS are devastating quickly. These problems will be dealt with if the richer countries agree to help by donating free drugs for the inflected population, sending doctors and nurses to treat and educate those in need, teaching the inflected citizens how to prevent this disease spread. 
 Furthermore, most economies of developing countries depends on exporting raw material and agricultural products as rice, corn. Then, they buy industrialized products from developed countries which result in financial deficit. This made poor countries have to borrow significant amount of money from World Bank which they can not repay even interest. Sometimes, the money disappears without any impact. Regarding to this issue, the G8 which include eight richest countries decided to forgive billions of dollars in debts owned by poor countries. 
 In conclusion, the rich countries play an important role in helping poor countries develop important areas such as trade, health and education. Besides rely on helps from rich countries, poor countries should take efforts by themselves.";"The world is becoming increasingly interconnected, and with this increased interconnectedness comes an increased responsibility to help those in need. Rich countries have the resources and the means to help those in poorer countries, and it is important that they do so.
 
 The most obvious way that rich countries can help poor countries is through financial aid. This can come in the form of direct aid, such as grants and loans, or it can come in the form of investments in infrastructure and development projects. Financial aid can help to alleviate poverty and provide access to basic needs such as food, water, and healthcare. It can also help to create jobs and stimulate economic growth in the recipient countries.
 
 In addition to providing financial aid, rich countries can also help poor countries by providing technical assistance. This can include providing expertise in areas such as agriculture, health, and education. Technical assistance can help to improve the quality of life in the recipient countries and can help to create a more equitable and just society.
 
 Finally, rich countries can also help poor countries by providing access to markets. This can include providing access to trade agreements and preferential tariffs, which can help to stimulate economic growth and create jobs. It can also include providing access to technology and knowledge, which can help to improve the quality of life in the recipient countries.
 
 In conclusion, it is clear that rich countries have a responsibility to help poor countries. Financial aid, technical assistance, and access to markets are all important ways that rich countries can help to alleviate poverty and create a more equitable and just society. It is important that rich countries recognize their responsibility and take action to help those in need.";"For centuries, the world has had an immense gap between the rich and the poor. This inequality is one of the most talked about issues of our time, and it is the source of immense suffering and despair in many developing countries. Many ask why rich countries should help poor countries, and what impact their assistance can have on world poverty. 
 
 To begin, it is important to recognize that rich countries have a moral obligation to help poor countries. Global poverty is an immense problem that affects millions of people, and it is the responsibility of those who have the resources to provide assistance. Everyone should have access to basic human needs and it is up to those with the power to help to make sure that happens. Furthermore, rich countries have largely benefited at the expense of poor countries, and it is their responsibility to share some of their resources to help those who are less fortunate.
 
 Moreover, helping poor countries does not only benefit them  it also helps rich countries. When rich countries provide financial aid, they help promote economic growth, which can reduce the need for immigrants from poorer countries. They also promote positive international relationships, which encourages trading partnerships and other forms of economic cooperation. This contributes to global security and stability, which consequently benefits all countries.
 
 In addition, helping poor countries can result in tangible and immediate impacts for those in need. Financial support can make a difference in the lives of individuals living in poverty, ensuring that they have access to clean water, food, and healthcare. It can also have a long-term impact by assisting with economic development, providing education opportunities and helping to reduce inequality. This can help create a more prosperous and equitable world.
 
 In conclusion, rich countries should help poor countries. They have a moral obligation to support those who are less fortunate, and to work towards eradicating global poverty. Moreover, assistance can have tangible benefits for all countries by promoting economic growth and international partnerships, as well as providing immediate impacts for those in need. This is why rich countries should not only strive to help poor countries, but must do so in order to create a more equitable world.";42;1886;1829;2343;2086.0
17;17;essay18.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/gender-equality-uni-admission-6913/;Gender Equality at university admission;"Nowadays men and women are equally participating in every field. Contrastingly, in the past time, women worked at home and performed sophisticated work. This factor is still affecting thinking of many people. They still believe that in present time women must do such type of work only. This tendency enforces universities to accept student according to the gender.
 Universities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders. Initially, if we look into the fact, women have proved themselves in every field whether it is indoor or outdoor. For example, nowadays women are working in home as well as in the sky. They are acting as a good housewife and they are flying planes also. Furthermore, university authority must not be biased on ground of the gender discrimination. They must consider the academic record of the student as main criteria of admission. 
 However, the current job market affects the decision of universities. Every university designs its courses according to the need of employers. The job selection criteria are pre decided. For instance employers need male candidates for the heavy work such as repairing and installation of heavy machine. They prefer male staff for night shifts. They want female candidates for soft natured work like counseling, teaching, designing etc. Therefore, universities follow the requirement of job providers and decide subject suitable for particular gender.
 To conclude, I strongly believe that universities much open choice for everyone to select his subject. Our youth has become very confident towards his career. They are not ready to be bound in certain limitations. Female candidates also do not care about any restriction posed by the society and the employer. So we must give them opportunity to achieve their goal.";"Gender equality is an important issue in many aspects of life, and university admissions is no exception. In recent years, universities have taken steps to ensure that their admissions processes are fair and equitable for all applicants, regardless of gender. This essay will discuss the importance of gender equality in university admissions, and the steps that universities have taken to ensure that their admissions processes are fair and equitable for all applicants.
 
 Gender equality in university admissions is important because it ensures that all applicants are given an equal opportunity to pursue higher education. This is especially important for women, who have historically been underrepresented in higher education. By ensuring that admissions processes are fair and equitable for all applicants, universities can help to create a more diverse and inclusive student body. This can help to create a more welcoming and supportive environment for all students, regardless of gender.
 
 Universities have taken a number of steps to ensure that their admissions processes are fair and equitable for all applicants. For example, many universities have implemented gender-blind admissions processes, which means that gender is not taken into account when making admissions decisions. This helps to ensure that all applicants are given an equal opportunity to pursue higher education, regardless of gender. Additionally, many universities have implemented affirmative action policies, which are designed to increase the representation of underrepresented groups in higher education. These policies can help to ensure that all applicants are given an equal opportunity to pursue higher education, regardless of gender.
 
 In conclusion, gender equality in university admissions is an important issue, and universities have taken steps to ensure that their admissions processes are fair and equitable for all applicants. By implementing gender-blind admissions processes and affirmative action policies, universities can help to create a more diverse and inclusive student body. This can help to create a more welcoming and supportive environment for all students, regardless of gender.";"Gender equality has become a hotly contested topic in the 21st century. The conversation has reached into all aspects of life, including university admissions. Historically, the gender gap in university admissions has been an issue that has been disproportionately disadvantageous to female applicants. In recent years, greater attention has been paid to creating a system of university admissions that is more equitable for all genders.
 
 At the core of gender equality in university admissions is the idea of equal consideration. This means that male and female applicants should be judged based on the same criteria, and should not be subjected to gender-biased evaluation. This can be accomplished through policy modifications, such as placing greater emphasis on academic merit, rather than subjective athletic or performance-based criteria. Additionally, institutions must ensure that an equitable number of faculty and other admissions staff are allocated to evaluate applications, regardless of gender. Universities must also ensure that applicants have the same opportunities for obtaining information about the admissions process and resources available to them, regardless of gender.
 
 Organizations such as the National Association for College Admission Counseling have taken an active role in promoting gender equality in university admissions by providing resources to colleges and universities across the United States. They are a strong voice for gender equity, advocating for more diverse student populations, and promoting the use of data analysis to identify gender gaps. Additionally, they provide resources aimed at helping colleges and universities to understand and address gender inequality in university admissions.
 
 Gender equality in university admissions is an important issue, and it must be addressed in order to create a more equitable educational system. By taking the necessary steps to enact policy modifications, and increasing awareness of the issue, universities can create an admissions process that is fair and equitable to all genders. Additionally, organizations such as the National Association for College Admission Counseling can empower universities with the tools needed to promote gender equity in university admissions. With these efforts, we can create a system of university admissions that puts all applicants on a more equal footing.";39;1788;2192;2389;2290.5

I believe that more reponsibilities should put on private individuals and companies such as paying to clean up air pollution. 
 First, in most industrialised countries, there is a number of companies that holds heavy factories in their constitutions. The waste products and harmful gases produced by these factories cause a significant amount of air pollution. While these companies make a huge amount of money from their bussinesses, most of them are not considering to take precautions to reduce the amount of air pollution. If these companies were obliged to pay to clean up the air pollution, they would at least make an effort to reduce the amount of air pollution they cause.
 Second, private individuals cause air pollution in several ways such as inessential use of cars and house heating. As house heating is a major need in the winter time, some households do not consider to use filters to reduce the amount of pollution that the heating causes. Instead of this, some expensive wehicles cause a huge amount of pollution. In my opinion, by charging private indiviuals for causing air pollution, that will at least contribute to reduce the amount of the pollution. 
 On the other hand, I believe that governments should restrict the use of products that cause air pollution for both individuals and companies. Governments also should use an amount of money from their budgets to clean up the air, instead of putting all the responsibility to companies and private individuals. 
 In conclusion, due to the fact that governments are responsible to provide a healthy enviorement for their inhabitants and they should be responsible from cleaning up the air pollution, both companies and private individuals should take the main part to clean up the air pollution.";"Air pollution is one of the most pressing environmental issues of our time. It is a major contributor to global warming, and it has been linked to a variety of health problems, including asthma, heart disease, and cancer. Air pollution is caused by a variety of sources, including burning fossil fuels, industrial emissions, and vehicle exhaust.
 
 The burning of fossil fuels is one of the primary sources of air pollution. When these fuels are burned, they release a variety of pollutants into the atmosphere, including carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides. These pollutants can react with other substances in the atmosphere to form smog and acid rain. Smog can reduce visibility, and acid rain can damage crops, buildings, and other structures.
 
 Industrial emissions are another major source of air pollution. These emissions can include a variety of pollutants, such as particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, and heavy metals. These pollutants can cause a variety of health problems, including respiratory illnesses and cancer.
 
 Vehicle exhaust is another major source of air pollution. Vehicles emit a variety of pollutants, including carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. These pollutants can react with other substances in the atmosphere to form smog and acid rain.
 
 There are a variety of ways to reduce air pollution. One way is to reduce the burning of fossil fuels. This can be done by using more efficient energy sources, such as solar and wind power. Another way is to reduce industrial emissions. This can be done by using more efficient production processes and by using cleaner fuels. Finally, vehicle exhaust can be reduced by using more efficient vehicles and by using cleaner fuels.
 
 In conclusion, air pollution is a major environmental issue that needs to be addressed. It is caused by a variety of sources, including burning fossil fuels, industrial emissions, and vehicle exhaust. There are a variety of ways to reduce air pollution, including using more efficient energy sources, reducing industrial emissions, and using more efficient vehicles. If we take action now, we can reduce air pollution and protect our health and the environment.";"Air pollution is a global environmental issue, with adverse health and environmental consequences that are becoming more severe as the population increases and modern lifestyle accelerates. There are various sources of air pollution, ranging from industrial and automotive emissions, to natural events such as forest fires and volcanic eruptions. Urban areas, in particular, are heavily polluted due to the increasing number of motor vehicles and industrial factories. Consequently, air pollution has become one of the leading causes of health problems and environmental degradation worldwide. Air pollution has multiple components, including particulate matter, ozone pollution, and toxic gases.
 
 Particulate matter comprises of particles such as dust, smoke, and soot that accumulate in the air. These particles can come from natural sources, such as windblown dust, and from man-made sources, such as exhaust from cars, trucks, and industrial emissions. When inhaled, these particles can cause a variety of respiratory illnesses, including asthma and bronchitis. In addition, these particles can cause a reduction in visibility, leading to respiratory hazards and reduced visibility. Ozone pollution is caused by the reaction of sunlight on emissions from cars, factories and power plants. Ozone forms a layer in the atmosphere that blocks the sun's ultraviolet rays, thus reducing air temperature and increasing the amount of ground-level ozone, which is toxic and can cause respiratory irritation.
 
 The presence of toxic gases in the air, such as nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide, can also cause serious health problems. These gases come primarily from the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Long-term exposure to these gases can cause serious respiratory illnesses, such as chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma. In addition, sulfur dioxide is a major component of acid rain, which can cause further damage to natural habitats and ecosystems.
 
 In order to reduce air pollution, a variety of measures can be taken. The most important is to reduce emissions from cars and industrial factories, as these are major sources of air pollution. This can be done by encouraging people to use public transport, cycling, and walking instead of driving their own cars. Governments can also implement regulations and laws to reduce emissions and increase the efficiency of industrial processes. Furthermore, the use of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, can help to reduce the production of pollutants. Finally, increasing public awareness of the dangers posed by air pollution can motivate people to take action and to adopt lifestyle changes that will reduce their exposure to air pollution.
 
 Overall, air pollution is a serious problem that needs to be addressed in order to protect public health and the environment. There are many potential solutions that should be explored and implemented, such as reducing emissions from vehicles and factories, utilizing renewable energy sources, and increasing public awareness of air pollution. Taking action now will help us to reduce air pollution and create a healthier and more sustainable future.";13;1930;2216;3212;2714.0
20;20;essay21.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/advertisements-affects-consumer-goods-preparing-7043/;Advertisements affects on consumer goods;"Everyday, companies offer a huge number of different products to consumers. The most effective way to convince consumers to purchase a product is through advertising. However, it is not sufficient in itself. The product also should satisfy the needs of the consumers. In my opinion, advertising is the major reason for high sales of a product for several reasons. 
 We are mainly introduced to products through advertisements. Therefore, advertisers push the limits of creativity to dispose the consumers to purchase the product. When the consumers are impressed by the way a product is advertised, they can be convinced to consider that the product is a need in some cases. Recently, there is a very creative advertisements of a soft drink product on TV. The story delivers a desired call to drink that soft drink that people tend to drink when the weather is too hot. As a result of this, the number of that product being sold will increases. 
 Also, the more an advertisement of a product takes place in mass media, the more popular the product becomes. Advertisement is the most effective way to create a well-known product. Consumers tend to purchase the most known product when it comes to picking one out of two different brands of the same product. When a product is commonly used, it becomes trustworthy for the society, no matter what quality it is.. However it also has to be affordable for the consumer. Considering this fact, advertisements have undeniable affects on the society about the product being advertised. They make the product preferable. 
 In conclusion, as I believe that consumers should consider major needs when they purchase goods, high sales are obviously a reflection of the powerful advertisements.";"Advertising is a powerful tool used by companies to influence consumer behavior and increase the demand for their products. It has become an integral part of the modern economy, and its effects on consumer goods are far-reaching. Advertising can be used to create brand loyalty, increase sales, and create a positive image of a product or company.
 
 Advertising can be used to create brand loyalty by creating an emotional connection between the consumer and the product. Companies use advertising to create an image of their product that is attractive and desirable. This can be done through the use of catchy slogans, attractive visuals, and celebrity endorsements. By creating an emotional connection with the consumer, companies can increase the likelihood that they will purchase their product.
 
 Advertising can also be used to increase sales of a product. Companies use advertising to create awareness of their product and to inform consumers about its features and benefits. This can be done through television, radio, and print advertisements. By creating awareness of a product, companies can increase the likelihood that consumers will purchase it.
 
 Finally, advertising can be used to create a positive image of a product or company. Companies use advertising to create a positive perception of their product and to create a sense of trust and loyalty among consumers. This can be done through the use of positive messages, attractive visuals, and celebrity endorsements. By creating a positive image of their product, companies can increase the likelihood that consumers will purchase it.
 
 In conclusion, advertising has a significant effect on consumer goods. It can be used to create brand loyalty, increase sales, and create a positive image of a product or company. Companies use advertising to create an emotional connection with the consumer, increase awareness of their product, and create a positive perception of their product. Advertising is an important tool used by companies to influence consumer behavior and increase the demand for their products.";"Advertising, when done correctly, has the potential to bring added value to the production of consumer goods. It can deliver relevant messages to consumers, build a relationship with them, and provide information about available options. However, advertising can also have a negative impact on consumer goods, as it increases the cost of production and can lead to false expectations of the goods being advertised. 
 
 To begin, advertising for consumer goods is typically quite costly. It requires considerable resources to create and implement. Companies must pay for the research and development, market research, and the actual production of advertisements, in addition to the cost of hiring an advertising agency or other professionals. This penchant to invest heavily in advertising has led to an increase in production costs, as companies look to increase their visibility and impact in the market.
 
 The rise in advertising also has the potential to create false expectations for consumers. Ads often show products in the best possible light and make them appear more attractive than they might actually be. Seeing a product in multiple ads could lead to a false sense of the quality of the product, which will not always meet the standards it promises. Furthermore, because of the high production costs of advertising, companies may end up cutting corners in other aspects of their production, such as quality of materials or labour, as a way to make up for the expenditure.
 
 Finally, while advertising has the potential to build a relationship between companies and consumers, it can sometimes result in over-targeting or exploitation. For instance, companies have been known to target certain demographics, such as youth, in order to get the most out of their ads. This could lead to use of manipulative tactics, such as appealing to emotions or creating a false sense of need, in order to increase their sales.
 
 In conclusion, advertising for consumer goods can have both positive and negative effects. At its best, it can bring added value and build a relationship with consumers. However, it also increases the cost of production, creates false expectations, and can result in exploitative or manipulative tactics. Companies must be aware of these potential pitfalls and strive to use advertising responsibly.";40;1731;2081;2328;2204.5
21;21;essay22.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/essay-young-people-should-go-university-not-17567/;Young people should go to university or not;"Persistent deliberation is happening as to whether it is desirable for the youth to go to university. In regard to the development of the country, some people believe that it is essential for young students to get high quality of education in universities, while others think that it is only one of causes to increase the rate of unemployment. In this essay, I will analyze both views first in order to come up with a fool-proof decision.
 To begin with, those who advocate the impracticability of university have several reasons. From their point of view, the fact is that there are numerous job opportunities for those who do not have the certification of university graduation, such as mechanics, sales persons, or engineers, and, furthermore, labors for graduates are in short supply. What is worse, the labor market for highly educated students is now too competitive to get a job after finishing their studying. In this regard it is a loss of national productivity that young people spend much time on searching for high salary jobs, even can be a sheer time-consuming.
 However, on the other side of the coin are voices in the opposition, saying that universities provide not only skills for careers, but also academic knowledge for the human race, such as bio science, politics, and medicine. These academic values are necessary to the progress of the world. More importantly, many researches in the ivory-tower have created ingenious discoveries and achievements for the development of modern society. Another significant factor of universities is that diverse experiences in the campus life can make the young generation more competently because there are a number of chances through internships, deeper discussion, independent life, and exchange scholarships.
 To sum up both contentions about the necessity of universities' education have reasonable justifications; however, I agree with the latter view. Although higher education does not guarantee young students' success, the benefits of learning in universities are the vital factor in creating more possibilities for the development of society through advancing academic fulfillment and the young generation who have experiences and challenges.
";"The debate of whether young people should go to university or not has been ongoing for many years. On one hand, there are those who believe that university is essential for young people to gain the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in the modern world. On the other hand, there are those who believe that university is not necessary and that young people should pursue other paths. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to attend university should be based on the individuals goals and aspirations.
 
 For those who are looking to pursue a career in a specific field, such as medicine, engineering, or law, university is often essential. In these fields, a degree is often required in order to gain employment. Furthermore, university provides an opportunity to gain the necessary skills and knowledge to excel in these fields. In addition, university can provide an opportunity to network and make connections with potential employers.
 
 For those who are looking to pursue a career in a more general field, such as business or finance, university may not be necessary. In these fields, experience and skills are often more important than a degree. Furthermore, there are many other paths to success, such as apprenticeships, internships, and self-learning.
 
 Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to attend university should be based on the individuals goals and aspirations. For those who are looking to pursue a career in a specific field, university may be essential. For those who are looking to pursue a career in a more general field, university may not be necessary. Ultimately, the decision should be based on the individuals goals and aspirations.";"Young people are at a crucial point of life where they have to decide whether to pursue further education at the university or college level or to enter the workplace with the qualifications they already have. This is an important decision that has implications for the individuals future not just financially but in terms of opportunities and skills as well. 
 
 The traditional route for young people is to go to university and pursue a degree. There are significant benefits to doing this including gaining qualifications that are more highly regarded in the job market, being equipped with specialist skills and knowledge suited to certain professions, gaining access to internships, networking opportunities and other career opportunities. It can also serve as a form of personal development as young people learn to manage their time, how to work autonomously and how to communicate their ideas. 
 
 On the other hand, it is not necessary for everyone to attend university. In some cases, the person may have sufficient skills and qualifications already suitable for a particular job. It is also possible to gain experience and certifications for various roles through the workplace, apprenticeships, or extra-curricular activities such as volunteering.
 
 Ultimately, whether a young person should go to university or not depends on their individual career goals, interests and resources available. It is important to be informed about the various options and to think carefully about the consequences of any decision made. With the right advice and guidance, young people can begin to make informed and suitable decisions based on their own ambitions.";43;2212;1678;1659;1668.5
22;22;essay23.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/essay-effects-mobile-phones-17519/;Effects of mobile phones;"Nowadays, the popularity of mobile phones has brought about a lot of convenience but at the meanwhile a variety of problems as well, such as social, medical and technical problems. However, I do not think these disadvantages will outweigh the advantages brought by cell phones. In this essay, I would like to analyse these three issues in order to support my viewpoint.
 First of all, almost everything that changed our lifestyle a lot will also cause some social problems. Mobile phones are not out of expectation. Speaking loudly on the phone in public areas, such as schools, libraries and hospitals appears to be very impolite and offensive. What is worse , some students utilize their cell phones as an effective cheating tools in examinations in which they can send and receive answers by texting each other. Nevertheless, it is not impossible to solve these problems, as long as some regulations and rules can be effectively implemented.
 It is also worth mentioning that some harmful effects on our health are lethal. It has been proved that overusing of the electronic devices including mobile phones could lead to higher possibility of suffering hearing loss and even cancers, although the further investigation are needed.
 Another debatable problem is about techniques. There is panic among people that their conversation can be intercepted by the third party. This possibility exists all the time. But a more efficient and reliable system can also be invented to guarantee the private information of users.
 Moreover, the mobile phone has become a dispensable multifunctional tools in people's daily life. Not only used for communication, but it also functions as an Internet browser, a music player , a personal organiser and so forth.
 In conclusion, nothing can be overused without side effects. The contribution of the mobile phone to our modern society is prominent and people's dependence on it is irreversible, although it has a number of problems that should be well handled.
";"The mobile phone is one of the most revolutionary inventions of the 21st century. It has changed the way we communicate, shop, and even entertain ourselves. But with all these advantages, there are also some negative effects of mobile phones.
 
 One of the most obvious effects of mobile phones is that they can be distracting. People are constantly checking their phones for notifications, messages, and emails. This can lead to a decrease in productivity and focus. It can also lead to an increase in stress and anxiety as people feel the need to constantly be connected.
 
 Another effect of mobile phones is that they can be a source of cyberbullying. People can use their phones to send hurtful messages or post embarrassing photos of others. This can have a devastating effect on the victims, leading to depression, anxiety, and even suicide.
 
 Mobile phones can also be a source of addiction. People can become addicted to their phones, spending hours scrolling through social media or playing games. This can lead to a decrease in physical activity, which can have a negative effect on physical and mental health.
 
 Finally, mobile phones can be a source of radiation. Studies have shown that long-term exposure to radiation from mobile phones can increase the risk of certain types of cancer.
 
 In conclusion, mobile phones can have both positive and negative effects. While they can be a great way to stay connected, they can also be a source of distraction, cyberbullying, addiction, and radiation. It is important to be aware of these potential risks and take steps to minimize them.";"The advent of mobile phones has brought about a significant change in the way people communicate and interact with each other. Mobile phones have become a ubiquitous part of modern life and are now used by many people around the world. Mobile phones can be used to send messages, make calls, access the internet, and even take photos and videos. However, despite the many benefits that mobile phones offer, there can be a range of adverse effects associated with their use. 
 
 One of the most significant effects of mobile phone use is the disruption of face-to-face communication. Mobile phones have made it easier for people to communicate with each other, but it has also reduced the amount of time that people spend communicating in person. This can lead to a sense of disconnection from the people around them and can even affect relationships. 
 
 The use of mobile phones can also have a negative effect on mental health. Research has shown that people who use their phone for prolonged periods of time may suffer from symptoms of anxiety or depression. This can lead to a greater sense of loneliness and isolation, which can further exacerbate mental health issues. 
 
 The use of mobile phones can also cause physical health problems. Prolonged use of mobile phones can lead to headaches, neck and shoulder pain, eye strain, and eyestrain. It can also lead to an increased risk of carpal tunnel syndrome due to the repetitive movement of typing on the phones small keyboard. 
 
 Finally, the use of mobile phones can lead to an increase in cyberbullying. People are now using their phones to bully and harass others. This can cause psychological distress and can even lead to serious physical harm. 
 
 In conclusion, it is important to take caution when using mobile phones. Although mobile phones offer a range of benefits, it is essential to be aware of the potential negative effects. People should ensure that they limit their use of mobile phones and that they interact regularly with people face-to-face in order to maintain healthy relationships.";24;1997;1598;2064;1831.0
23;23;essay24.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/undergraduate-essays-2/taks-essay-computer-has-negative-effects-children-17155/;computer has negative effects to children;"Nowadays, thanks to the development of technology, computer is now indispensable to life. Some people think that computer is good for children and it should be used daily by children but some others think differently. In my opinion, the latter opinion is true.
 First, using computer constantly has bad influence on children's eyes. When they concentrate on computer for too long, their eyes will get tired, which is the main reason for some eyes problems, typically shortsighted.
 Moreover, children who play games too much on computer can seriously lack communicating skills, they will know little about the outside life. It is a well-known fact that people who are addicted to games, especially online games, can eventually bear dangerous consequences. For instance, several teenagers play games without rest, which leads to health depression, a typical example is the death of Korean gamer, who had a non-stop playing for 3 days.
 Finally, even people who are not interested in online game can still be negatively affected by using computer too much. Some social surveys have shown that a few children use computer for studying purpose, most of them are attracted by facebook, blog, etc. instead. Due to this neglect, they will have a bad result in school because when they can not live without internet, they will have no time for their studying.
 In conclusion, although it is undeniable that computer is a crucial part of human life, it still has its bad side, especially for children. People should learn how to use it properly to make it an effective tool because computer should be used not only for entertaining but also for working and studying purpose.
";"In recent years, the use of computers has become increasingly prevalent in our society. While computers can be a valuable tool for learning, they can also have a negative effect on children. This essay will discuss the various ways in which computers can have a negative effect on children.
 
 First, the use of computers can lead to physical health problems in children. Prolonged use of computers can lead to physical health problems such as eyestrain, headaches, and neck and back pain. Additionally, children who spend too much time on the computer may not be getting enough physical activity, which can lead to obesity and other health problems.
 
 Second, computers can have a negative effect on childrens mental health. Too much time spent on the computer can lead to isolation from family and friends, as well as a lack of social skills. Additionally, children may become addicted to computer games or other online activities, leading to a lack of focus on schoolwork and other important tasks.
 
 Finally, computers can have a negative effect on childrens education. Too much time spent on the computer can lead to a lack of focus on schoolwork and other important tasks. Additionally, children may become so engrossed in computer games or other online activities that they neglect their studies. This can lead to poor academic performance and a lack of interest in learning.
 
 In conclusion, while computers can be a valuable tool for learning, they can also have a negative effect on children. Prolonged use of computers can lead to physical health problems, mental health problems, and a lack of focus on schoolwork and other important tasks. Therefore, it is important for parents to monitor their childrens computer use and ensure that it is not having a negative effect on their health and education.";"In the last few decades, technological advancements have seen the integration of computers in every sphere of life. Computer technology has revolutionized how people work, learn, and socialize. One such area of life affected by computers is parenting and the effect it has had on children. As computers have become an integral part of our lives, some have expressed concern over their negative effects on the development of children.
 
 Computer technology has often been criticized for the negative effects it has on childrens physical, social, and cognitive development. One of the primary concerns is the amount of time children spend on computers. It is well documented that long periods of screen time can lead to health concerns such as obesity, poor posture, and eye strain. In addition, excessive computer usage often leads to children lacking the social skills necessary for healthy social interactions. This can be seen in children who may be more comfortable interacting with a computer instead of people, or those who use computers to hide from social interaction instead of embracing it.
 
 The cognitive development of children is also at risk when they spend too much time on computers. In addition to the physical and social issues, computers can also have a negative impact on learning and educational achievement. Computers make it much easier for children to access information, but it often fails to facilitate deeper learning. Technology can often lead to the development of shallow learning habits, as children prefer activities that offer quick rewards, such as games and social media. This leads to them being exposed to a lot of information, but being unable to truly understand or remember it.
 
 Finally, computers can also lead to significant concerns when it comes to child safety. The internet is full of potential dangers such as cyberbullying, online predators, and inappropriate content. In order to ensure that children remain safe online, parents should be aware of the websites, apps, and online activities their children are engaging in.
 
 In conclusion, while computers can offer many benefits, they also have a great potential to cause negative effects on children. Parents should take care to ensure that their children spend time in moderation on computers and also be aware of their online activities in order to protect them. By doing this, parents can enable children to benefit from the education and entertainment computers offer, while avoiding the detrimental effects of too much computer usage.";41;1666;1816;2544;2180.0
24;24;essay25.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/undergraduate-essays-2/essay-influence-large-factory-17115/;Influence Of Large Factory;"Nowadays, whether to establish large factories nearby housing areas has become a controversial issue in our society. Out of the case of economic development, industrial buildings are a necessary part of modern society. However a vast number of people are against building a factory near their community because of pollution. From my point of view, the advantages of building a factory will outweigh its disadvantages, if we tackle the environmental problems brought by factories.
 First of all, a large factory can stimulate local economic growth and reduce the unemployment rate. To manufacture goods, there must be the demand of laborers, from which the local residents can benefit. What is more, the factory is not isolated, other industries and business will be quickly established, resulting in economic growth of local area. For example, the estate industry will be boosted in order to satisfy the workers' accommodation need.
 The main disadvantage is contamination. It is truth that some area are suffering the dire consequences caused by overdeveloping the industry, such as water pollution, overcrowded traffic and medical problems. For instance, in some industrial cities , a large proportion of the workers are suffering various breathing problems, such as asthma which can be caused by waste ashes and certain chemical substances.
 However, it is inevitable that there will be more factories built with the development of our society. Therefore, how to improve the disadvantages of building a factory would be more important than whether to build it. In fact most problems can be avoidable if the factories put in real and great effort to manage their waste well.
 In conclusion, installation of manufacturing plant is a trend of industrialization for many countries. Its advantages will outweigh disadvantages as long as the factories dispose their waste and pollution in the correct way.
";"On Environment
 
 The industrial revolution of the 19th century brought about a massive change in the way people lived and worked. The introduction of large factories and the mass production of goods had a profound effect on the environment. The large factories produced a huge amount of pollution, which had a detrimental effect on the air, water, and land.
 
 The air pollution caused by large factories is one of the most serious environmental issues. The burning of fossil fuels to power the factories releases a variety of pollutants into the atmosphere, including carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. These pollutants can cause a variety of health problems, including asthma, bronchitis, and other respiratory illnesses. In addition, the pollutants can contribute to global warming and climate change.
 
 The water pollution caused by large factories is also a major environmental concern. The factories often dump their waste into nearby rivers and lakes, which can contaminate the water and make it unsafe for drinking or swimming. The pollutants can also cause algal blooms, which can lead to the death of fish and other aquatic life.
 
 The land pollution caused by large factories is also a major environmental concern. The factories often dump their waste onto the land, which can contaminate the soil and make it unsuitable for growing crops. The pollutants can also leach into the groundwater, which can make it unsafe for drinking or bathing.
 
 In conclusion, the influence of large factories on the environment is undeniable. The air, water, and land pollution caused by the factories can have a detrimental effect on human health and the environment. It is important for governments to regulate the factories and ensure that they are not releasing pollutants into the environment. It is also important for individuals to reduce their consumption of goods produced in large factories and to support businesses that are more environmentally friendly.";"Owners On Industrialization
 
 Industrialization has been a critical keystone of economic development across the world since the industrial revolution of the early 18th century. The development of factories and technology has allowed for increased production, improved living standards, and greater economic opportunities for a variety of individuals. As such, it is easy to look at factory owners as a crucial element when it comes to the industrialization processes. The large factory owners, in particular, have had a significant influence in advancing industrialization in the modern world.
 
 The primary influence of large factory owners is the increase of wealth they bring to areas where their factories are built. These owners are able to create jobs and establish businesses to serve the needs of their factories, which in turn bolsters the local economies. As a result, the standard of living increases, poverty decreases, and the local infrastructure is improved. This allows for more opportunities for individuals to benefit from industrialization, as it becomes easier for them to access the resources and potential afforded by the increased production of goods and services.
 
 The large factory owners are also able to provide international connections for the communities in which their factories are located. By having access to international markets, local businesses are able to take advantage of new opportunities and new sources of income. This further strengthens the local economies, as more people have access to resources and potential for success. In addition, the factory owners are usually able to provide financing for new projects, which can help jumpstart the economic growth of the communities in which their factories are located.
 
 Finally, the influence of large factory owners goes beyond economic development. The owners often help to shape the culture of the areas in which they operate, both through their own practices and those of the businesses they establish. They are also able to bring in new ideas and approaches to production and place an emphasis on the importance of technology and modern methods. As a result, the communities in which their factories are located can benefit from advances in production, efficiency, and safety.
 
 In conclusion, large factory owners have had a significant influence over the development of industrialization in the modern world. Their ability to bolster local economies, provide international connections, and shape culture allow them to push industrialization forward. As such, they are an essential element to the current developments in production, efficiency, and safety.";26;1903;2002;2661;2331.5
25;25;essay26.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/essay-prepared-food-17090/;Prepared Food;"Nowadays, more and more people begin to select prepared food as their daily meals, since it can effectively save time which is considered as money in our modern society. However it is obvious that cooked food can bring about some negative influence result from utilizing the artificial ingredients, ignoring the nutrition of food and modifying people's eating habits. In this essay, I would like to explain why this is not a good thing based on the three reasons above.
 First of all, to make their food easier to prepare and taste delicious, almost every producer adds a wide range of artificial ingredients in to the food that is now purchased by most people. Some ingredients being added have caused dire consequences. For instance, there are usually some articles in newspapers and magazines which report the relationship between certain chemical components in some food and diseases. Thus, easy-to-cook foods sometimes could be dangerous for human's health.
 Not cooking fresh food will also lead to the lack of nutrition. It is truth that cooking prepared foods needs much less time in comparison with the fresh food., whereas some research has apparently demonstrated that prepared foods are unable to support enough nutrients we need, especially for children who are growing up .
 In addition, cooking is one of arts humans create. The more cooked food we chosen, the more cooking skills we lose. At the increasing living pace, the majority of people tend to choose microwave as their unique cooker that help them prepare a dish in five minutes. But rare people have been aware that this has contributed to a modification of cooking habits, which may cause the loss of our custom and culture about cooking.
 In conclusion, although the invention of prepared foods definitely satisfies the demand of some people who are busy in their work, it is not a good thing. Cooking is not a waste of time, contrarily, it is crucial for our health and culture.
";"Prepared food is a type of food that has been cooked, processed, or packaged in some way before it is consumed. Prepared food can be found in grocery stores, restaurants, and even in some homes. Prepared food has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its convenience and ease of preparation.
 
 Prepared food can be beneficial in many ways. For one, it can save time and energy. Prepared food is often ready to eat or heat up quickly, making it a great option for busy individuals who dont have the time or energy to cook from scratch. Prepared food can also be a great way to save money, as it is often cheaper than buying ingredients and making a meal from scratch. Additionally, prepared food can be a great way to get a variety of flavors and textures in one meal.
 
 However, there are some drawbacks to prepared food. For one, it can be high in sodium, fat, and sugar. Additionally, many prepared foods are highly processed and may contain artificial ingredients and preservatives. This can be unhealthy and can also lead to a lack of nutrients in the diet.
 
 In conclusion, prepared food can be a great option for those who are short on time or money. However, it is important to be aware of the potential drawbacks of prepared food and to make sure to include a variety of fresh, unprocessed foods in the diet.";"Food permeates every aspect of our lives. We have the option of cooking our own meals or purchasing pre-made or prepared food from a store. Prepared food is defined as any type of food that has been processed, packaged, and ready to be eaten, either at home or in a restaurant. While some may think that prepared food is an easy and convenient way to feed oneself, there are a few arguments against this that should be taken into consideration.
 
 One of the major arguments against prepared food is how processed it is. When food is processed, the nutritional value is often dramatically diminished, as many of the vitamins and minerals are lost in the process. Furthermore, many prepared foods are loaded with sugar, fat, and other unhealthy components that can lead to health problems down the line. Prepared food is also often expensive, as it is more labor intensive than preparing meals from scratch.
 
 Another issue with prepared food is its environmental impact. Much of the packaging and processing associated with prepared food results in a lot of waste production. This waste often ends up in landfills, or worse, in the oceans. Furthermore, much of the food used in prepared meals come from factory farms, which have been linked with animal cruelty and environmental damage.
 
 Lastly, prepared food can lead to feelings of disconnection from ones food. When meals are prepared from scratch, with fresh, local ingredients, it is easier to appreciate where your food comes from and the work that goes into preparing it. Conversely, pre-made meals provide little to no connection to food production.
 
 In conclusion, while there are some benefits to prepared food such as convenience and cost, there are also some drawbacks that should be taken into consideration. From an environmental perspective, the amount of waste produced and the sourcing of ingredients can be concerning. Furthermore, the health implications associated with consuming processed food, as well as the disconnection from ones food, are serious considerations. All in all, it is important to weigh the pros and cons of prepared food before deciding if it is the right choice for you.";13;1957;1332;2166;1749.0
26;26;essay27.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/essay-financial-aid-developing-countries-17035/;Financial Aid To Developing Countries;"As is commonly understood, there is an increasingly gap between developed countries and developing countries. It can be seen that some developed countries and organization are proving financial assistance to the impoverished countries. However, it is disagreed that this can be the best and only way to assist developing countries. This will be proven by analyzing the necessity of developing their education and the real objective of supporters.
 Firstly, education is an essential part in development. For instance, most developing countries are lack of educational resources, such as experienced teachers, evaluation systems and teaching facilities, which is usually neglected by local authorities. From this example, it is obvious that if the developed countries are unwilling to share their successful experience in education, the developing countries will remain undeveloped, even though they gain a great deal of economic support. Thus, the critical method to improve the condition of poor countries is to help them build up a complete educational system instead of financial aid.
 In addition, it is well acknowledged that there is no free lunch in the world. This means some powerful countries provide financial support in order to acquire the right to exploit the local resources and target the local labour market. Indeed, they rarely provide local residents with any technological aid and even cause contamination in some areas. Therefore, developing countries should not totally depend on the financial support from powerful countries.
 In conclusion, financial aid is not the only way to assist poor countries. And it has been proven that developing education and improving national technology and science level are the path they have to undergo if they really want to alter current situation.
";"Financial aid to developing countries is a critical issue in the current global economy. Developing countries are those countries that are in the process of industrialization and economic growth, but are still considered to be relatively poor in comparison to the developed countries. Financial aid to developing countries is essential for their economic development and growth.
 
 Financial aid to developing countries can come in the form of grants, loans, and other forms of assistance. Grants are typically given to developing countries in order to help them build infrastructure, improve education, and provide basic services. Loans are typically given to developing countries in order to help them finance projects that will help them become more competitive in the global economy. Other forms of assistance can include technical assistance, capacity building, and trade promotion.
 
 Financial aid to developing countries is important for a variety of reasons. First, it helps to reduce poverty and inequality in the developing world. By providing financial assistance, developing countries can invest in projects that will help to create jobs and increase economic growth. This in turn can lead to improved living standards and better access to basic services.
 
 Second, financial aid to developing countries can help to reduce the risk of conflict and instability. By providing financial assistance, developing countries can invest in projects that will help to reduce poverty and inequality, which can help to reduce the risk of conflict and instability.
 
 Third, financial aid to developing countries can help to promote economic development and growth. By providing financial assistance, developing countries can invest in projects that will help to create jobs and increase economic growth. This in turn can lead to improved living standards and better access to basic services.
 
 Finally, financial aid to developing countries can help to promote global economic stability. By providing financial assistance, developing countries can invest in projects that will help to reduce poverty and inequality, which can help to reduce the risk of conflict and instability. This in turn can lead to improved global economic stability.
 
 In conclusion, financial aid to developing countries is essential for their economic development and growth. It helps to reduce poverty and inequality, reduce the risk of conflict and instability, promote economic development and growth, and promote global economic stability. Therefore, it is important that developed countries continue to provide financial assistance to developing countries in order to help them achieve their economic goals.";"Financial aid has become an essential tool for promoting development and poverty reduction in the worlds poorest countries. The need for financial assistance from wealthy countries to those less fortunate has been a long-standing moral obligation. According to the United Nations Development Programme, approximately 767 million people worldwide are still living in extreme poverty. This number is exceeded in developing countries where nearly half of their population lives below the poverty line. 
 
 In response to this situation, developed countries have increased their financial assistance by investing billions of dollars in developing countries through official development assistance (ODA) and foreign aid. This financial assistance makes it possible for governments in these countries to implement policies and programs that directly benefit the poorest in their population. For example, assistance to poor countries provides funds to build infrastructure, improve public health, and provide better education services. As a result, this financial aid is essential in reducing extreme poverty and promoting long-term social and economic development.
 
 Financial assistance to developing countries also allows their government to invest in human and physical capital. Investing in human capital is important for providing people with the skills and knowledge needed for a better quality of life and more productive work. This investment in human capital also helps support economic growth and stability as it helps people to become more productive, efficient, and innovative. Additionally, investing in physical capital, such as infrastructure and technology, allows countries to improve access to resources and services, which leads to greater economic growth and development. 
 
 Finally, foreign aid helps developing countries to become more competitive in the global economy. It provides these countries with the resources and capital necessary to invest in their industries, build infrastructure and institutions, and expand trade activities. All these efforts can improve the standard of living and boost economic growth, which can lead to a greater level of global economic integration.
 
 To conclude, foreign aid to developing countries is an essential tool for promoting development and poverty reduction. It allows governments to invest in human and physical capital, which leads to greater economic growth and development. Furthermore, foreign aid helps to make developing countries more competitive in the global economy, thus improving the standard of living for their citizens. In this way, foreign aid is a powerful tool for achieving social and economic progress.";37;1808;2691;2689;2690.0
27;27;essay28.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/society-should-ban-all-forms-advertising-essay-for-16697/;Society should ban all forms of the advertising;"It is no secret that advertising become inseparable part of our modern life. We come across with ads almost everywhere and everyday. Some people argue that companies by advertising their goods or services spend their money for nothing. Other critics say that ads have no purpose, they only cause damages to society and all forms of advertising should be banned.
 On my part I would like to solve this issue on a different way. Society does need an advertising but it is our responsibility to control the content and what kind of goods and services we would like to offer to our customers.
 First of all, I do support the idea that advertising alcohol, cigarettes, goods and services with adult content should be prohibited. Because these kind of ads will have negative effect to our children. Youngsters might be tempted to buy cigarettes or alcohol and later to start consume it on a daily basis. Fortunately, some countries take this issue seriously and advertising alcohol, cigarettes and materials with adult content is banned on those countries.
 On the other hand by advertising companies, businesses, firms and individuals promote their goods and services. Thanks to ads we learn about new products, we can compare them and choose whats it the best for us.
 These days, not only many businesses, but also governments have to rely on advertising. For example, tourism makes up one-third of the Czech Republic's economy. In order to promote the country's attractions, the Czech government has to advertise and sell its services to foreign consumers. Only well planned and well targeted advertising will bring more foreign tourists to the country.
 In conclusion, I think that modern society needs advertising. Ads will keep as well informed about new products and services, but we should also bear in mind that advertising cigarettes and alcohol will definitely affect our children in negative way.
";"Advertising has become an integral part of modern society, with companies spending billions of dollars each year to promote their products and services. While advertising can be beneficial in some cases, it can also be detrimental to society. This is why it is important to consider the potential harms of advertising and consider whether society should ban all forms of advertising.
 
 The primary argument for banning all forms of advertising is that it can be damaging to society. Advertising can be used to manipulate people into buying products they dont need or cant afford. It can also be used to promote unhealthy lifestyles, such as smoking or drinking alcohol. Advertising can also be used to spread false information or to create a false sense of urgency in order to get people to buy something. All of these practices can be damaging to society, as they can lead to increased debt, health problems, and even fraud.
 
 Another argument for banning all forms of advertising is that it can be intrusive and distracting. Advertising can be seen everywhere, from billboards to television commercials. This can be distracting and can take away from the quality of life of those who are exposed to it. It can also be intrusive, as companies can use personal data to target people with ads that are tailored to their interests. This can be seen as an invasion of privacy and can be seen as unethical.
 
 Finally, banning all forms of advertising could help to reduce inequality in society. Advertising can be used to target certain groups of people, such as those who are low-income or those who are from minority groups. This can lead to disparities in access to products and services, as well as in the quality of products and services that are available. By banning all forms of advertising, companies would be unable to target certain groups of people and would have to compete on a level playing field.
 
 In conclusion, there are many arguments for banning all forms of advertising. Advertising can be damaging to society, intrusive and distracting, and can lead to inequality. For these reasons, it is important to consider whether society should ban all forms of advertising.";"Advertising is a multi-billion dollar industry which has tremendous influence on consumer buying decisions. Its primary purpose is to be persuasive and create the desire to buy products, services and ideas. Advertising has become a pervasive force in our daily lives and its impact on our culture is undeniable. While advertising can be beneficial to marketers, it can also be damaging to society. For this reason, many people argue that society should ban all forms of advertising.
 
 One reason why society should ban all forms of advertising is because it can be misleading. Advertising companies create persuasive messages that may not be entirely accurate. Such misleading advertising can cause consumers to believe they are getting a product they are not and can lead them to purchase something they dont actually need. Furthermore, companies can use false claims to make their products seem superior to those of their competitors, which can create an unfair competitive advantage.
 
 In addition, advertising often promotes unhealthy consumer habits. It has been found that exposure to advertising can lead to increased consumption of sugary drinks, unhealthy snacks, and fast food. This can lead to an increase in obesity, diabetes, and other serious health problems. Advertising can also encourage harmful behavior such as smoking or excessive drinking. Finally, it can also be responsible for creating pressure on people to buy things beyond their financial means.
 
 Finally, advertising can be detrimental to the environment. Advertising companies use resources that can have a negative impact on the environment such as large amounts of paper, plastic, and even fuel. Furthermore, many advertisements use energy-hungry technologies such as large billboards, which can be a major source of pollution.
 
 In conclusion, there is much evidence that suggests that society should ban all forms of advertising. Advertising can be misleading, can encourage unhealthy habits and behaviors, and can have a detrimental effect on the environment. By banning all forms of advertising, society can safeguard consumers from deceptive marketing practices and protect the environment.";47;1904;2187;2181;2184.0
28;28;essay29.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/essay-married-women-usually-work-why-not-16560/;Do married women usually work? Why and why not?;"Personally, I believe that married women nowadays have right to take up jobs like men when employment discrimination based on gender have been erased significantly. Working outside home will bring a lot of benefits to both married woman and their household. I will mention some basic reasons as following.
 Firstly, extra income that women earn will contribute to their family's expenses. By taking up a job, a wife can earn more money to support her family life. This is really necessary in cases of her husband's low salary and the difficulty of getting a good job at the present. So, it is a normal practice for women to be helpmates in earning money.
 Secondly, working outside the house creates opportunities for married women to contact with the outer world, strengthen their character and show their capacity. These things in turn will make them more confident, independent. These women will set a good example for their children. Therefore, it is no doubt that they play roles as a mother and as a wife better.
 Last but not least, nowadays, there are many supporting conditions that help women balance housework and work. Besides the gorvernment's policies on limited families and their husbands' sharing in the housework, many employers are willing to offer part-time jobs for women.
 In conclusion, a well-organized home does not need the housewife's presence the whole day long and married women could go to work in order to enjoy the working life outside the home.
";"Married women usually work for a variety of reasons. In many cases, it is a necessity in order to help support the family financially. In other cases, married women may choose to work in order to pursue a career or to gain personal fulfillment.
 
 For many married women, working is a necessity. With the cost of living rising and wages not keeping up, it is often necessary for both spouses to work in order to make ends meet. This is especially true for families with children, as childcare costs can be expensive. In addition, many married couples have large amounts of debt, such as student loans or mortgages, that require both spouses to work in order to pay them off.
 
 For other married women, working is a choice. Many women choose to pursue a career in order to gain personal fulfillment or to advance in their field. This can be especially true for women who have been out of the workforce for a period of time, such as after having children. Working can give them a sense of purpose and help them to stay connected to the professional world.
 
 In addition, many married women choose to work in order to gain financial independence. This can be especially important for women who are in relationships where the husband is the primary breadwinner. Working can give them a sense of financial security and independence that can be invaluable.
 
 Overall, married women usually work for a variety of reasons. In some cases, it is a necessity in order to support the family financially. In other cases, it is a choice in order to pursue a career or gain personal fulfillment. In addition, it can be a way to gain financial independence.";"The simple answer to the question of whether married women usually work is ""it depends."" There is no one-size-fits-all answer, as the decision of whether or not to work is a complex one involving many different factors. There are many factors that can influence a married womans decision to work or not, such as her familys finances and financial goals, her level of education and work experience, the availability of job opportunities in her area, the cost of childcare and the availability of support from extended family, her personal career aspirations and values, and her husbands opinion.
 
 For many married women, the economic considerations of whether or not to work are central. If a couple's income is not sufficient to cover their expenses and provide for a comfortable lifestyle, it may be necessary for the wife to join the workforce in order to supplement the family's income. In some cases, a second income can help a couple move to a better neighborhood, support their children's education, or save for retirement.
 
 In other cases, a married woman might choose to seek employment out of a desire to advance her career or to pursue a passion. In todays society, it is increasingly common for married women to have their own career paths and to prioritize the development of their professional skills and identities. This can be especially true for those women who have attainments that are highly valued in the job market, such as advanced education and professional certifications.
 
 On the flip side, some married women opt not to work, often due to personal or family circumstances. For instance, if a couple decides that one parent should take on the responsibilities of full-time childcare, the mother is more likely to take on that role. As childcare costs can be so high, the mother's salary might not cover the cost of daycare and other associated costs, thus making it more financially sensible for the mother to stay home. Additionally, if a couple has extended family in the area who can provide childcare and other support, the mother might choose to stay home to care for her children.
 
 Ultimately, whether or not a married woman chooses to work is a personal decision. There is no right or wrong answer, and the decision ought to be made with careful consideration of all of the factors involved. It is important to remember that, regardless of her decision, a married womans worth and value are not limited by her employment status.";47;1478;1644;2468;2056.0

I completely agree that government should provide those education to their people; however, for the more higher education like university, the students or their parents should pay for the fees.
 Some parents might not have enough money to pay for their children university fees. In the other hand, I don't think it is also fair for the government as the government has been paying a lot of money for their students' primary and secondary education. It is better for them to use the money to pay for the other students' education so that all people in their country could receive the same education.
 Moreover, students that already have a basic knowledge and education can get a part-time job and they can pay for their own studies when their parent could not afford to pay it. They will be more responsible with their studies when they pay the fees themselves. In addition to that, the students will become more independent and it will build their characters in the marketplace as well.
 Furthermore, this will encourage all the parents to think of the way to help their children to achieve more in their lives as they need to make some contribution too for their children future.
 In conclusion, I completely agree that government should not pay for the university fees because this will make both the parents and students in charge for their future themselves not just depend on the government to do all their responsibilities for them.
";"Government and education are two of the most important components of any society. Governments are responsible for providing the resources and infrastructure necessary for education to take place, while education is responsible for providing the knowledge and skills necessary for citizens to be productive members of society.
 
 The relationship between government and education is a complex one. Governments provide the resources and infrastructure necessary for education to take place, such as funding for schools and universities, and laws and regulations that govern the education system. Governments also set educational standards and policies that determine what is taught in schools and universities.
 
 At the same time, education is responsible for providing the knowledge and skills necessary for citizens to be productive members of society. Education helps to prepare citizens for the workforce and to be informed citizens who can participate in the political process. Education also helps to create a more equitable society by providing opportunities for all citizens to reach their full potential.
 
 The relationship between government and education is a symbiotic one. Governments need educated citizens to be productive members of society, while education needs the resources and infrastructure provided by governments in order to be effective. Without government support, education would not be able to provide the knowledge and skills necessary for citizens to be productive members of society.
 
 In conclusion, government and education are two of the most important components of any society. Governments provide the resources and infrastructure necessary for education to take place, while education provides the knowledge and skills necessary for citizens to be productive members of society. The relationship between government and education is a symbiotic one, and both are necessary for a society to be successful.";"The relationship between government and education is an integral one, with both parties impacting the other in various ways. Governments are responsible for providing financial support to educational institutions within their jurisdiction, while educational providers are responsible for providing quality educational opportunities to their students. This symbiotic relationship has been in place for centuries, with government leaders and educators working together to ensure the educational needs of their citizens are met.
 
 For centuries, governments have been responsible for creating and upholding educational standards, often through formal legislation. This includes the setting of curriculum standards, training requirements for educators, and oversight of educational facilities. Governments also provide funding to educational institutions in the form of grants and subsidies, which can be used to support the cost of operations such as libraries, technology, and textbooks. Through these initiatives, governments are able to ensure that a minimum educational standard is maintained.
 
 Education providers also play a key role in the relationship between government and education. They are responsible for providing quality educational opportunities to students and for ensuring these opportunities meet the standards set by the government. This includes providing certified educators and up-to-date curriculum materials. Educational institutions also provide valuable feedback to governments on how the current system is working, allowing for necessary changes to be made when needed.
 
 The relationship between government and education is an important one, as it has a direct impact on the educational opportunities available to citizens. Governments play a key role in providing financial support and setting standards, while educational institutions are responsible for providing quality educational opportunities. By working together in this way, both parties are able to ensure the educational needs of their citizens are met. This relationship is critical to the development of any society, and should be maintained and nurtured by both sides.";24;1538;1941;2164;2052.5
30;30;essay31.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/alternative-forms-transport-alleviate-traffic-congestion-40138/;Alternative forms of transport to alleviate traffic congestion;"Recently, a great deal of attention has been paid to means of transportation. Some state that automobile is the most convenient transportation, while others assert that alternative forms of transport should be considered in view of environmental pollution. In my opinion, I strongly agree that alternative means of transportation and international laws in controlling automobiles should be introduced. In this essay, several reasons will be described carefully in the following passages.
 Firstly, an increase in the number of automobiles brings about environmental pollution. Since automobile exhaust and carbon dioxides emission have bad impacts on the air, the air gets to be polluted and it causes respiratory disease of the local inhabitants. Therefore, it is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles.
 Secondly, an increase in the number of automobiles causes terrible traffic congestion. Once we get into the traffic jam, it forces us to waste our time for a while. What is worse, traffic congestion irritates drivers and as a result, it leads to an increase of traffic accidents. Thus, the methods to reduce the number of automobiles and to control car ownership and use should be immediately planned and implemented.
 In order to solve these problems, alternative forms of transportation and international laws to control automobiles ownership and use can work effectively. With regard to the former, alternative forms which emit less carbon dioxides and gasses than automobiles are ideal. For example, rental bicycle system has been introduced in several European countries. This system is that at the corner of each district, the rental bicycles are placed and the people can ride it to the other districts with a small fee. Since bicycle expels neither carbon dioxides nor harmful gasses, it is a better form to protect environment than automobile. As for the latter point, the introduction of international laws can be also effective. For instance, there are some regulations to limit the use of automobiles by time and to allow the people possess one car only. Thus, these attempts to reduce automobiles can ease traffic congestion and environmental pollution.
 In summary, even though some people claim the convenience of automobile, I would state that alternative forms of transport and international laws on controlling automobiles are necessary due to the environmental protection and the alleviation of traffic congestion.
";"Introduction
 
 Traffic congestion is a major problem in many cities around the world. It can cause delays, air pollution, and even accidents. To alleviate this problem, alternative forms of transport must be explored. This essay will discuss the potential of public transport, cycling, and walking as viable alternatives to cars and other motorized vehicles.
 
 Public Transport
 
 Public transport is one of the most effective ways to reduce traffic congestion. It is a convenient and affordable way for people to get around, and it can help reduce the number of cars on the road. Public transport systems can include buses, trains, trams, and even ferries. These systems can be used to connect different parts of a city, making it easier for people to get around without having to drive.
 
 Cycling
 
 Cycling is another alternative form of transport that can help reduce traffic congestion. It is a healthy and environmentally friendly way to get around, and it can help reduce the number of cars on the road. Cycling is also relatively inexpensive, and it can be used to travel short distances.
 
 Walking
 
 Walking is an often overlooked form of transport, but it can be a great way to reduce traffic congestion. It is a healthy and environmentally friendly way to get around, and it can help reduce the number of cars on the road. Walking is also relatively inexpensive, and it can be used to travel short distances.
 
 Conclusion
 
 In conclusion, traffic congestion is a major problem in many cities around the world. To alleviate this problem, alternative forms of transport must be explored. Public transport, cycling, and walking are all viable alternatives to cars and other motorized vehicles, and they can help reduce the number of cars on the road. These forms of transport are also healthy, environmentally friendly, and relatively inexpensive.";"Introduction
 
 Traffic congestion is a major problem in many cities around the world, leading to long commute times, increased air pollution, and higher stress levels for drivers. While most cities are attempting to tackle this issue by improving public transport systems, this is not always the most effective solution. Alternative forms of transportation can be a great way to reduce traffic congestion and improve the quality of life for commuters. This essay will discuss some alternative forms of transport that can help alleviate traffic congestion.
 
 Bicycle lanes
 
 One of the most effective ways to reduce traffic congestion is to increase the number of people who opt to cycle to work or to other destinations instead of using their car. The installation of dedicated bicycle lanes is one way of encouraging people to choose this form of transportation. Bicycle lanes provide a safe and dedicated route for cyclists to travel, making it easier for them to commute to and from work. Additionally, the construction of bicycle lanes can help to free up road space for other vehicles, reducing overall traffic congestion.
 
 Ridesharing
 
 Ridesharing is a form of transportation that involves individuals sharing a car to travel to their destination. By allowing multiple people to ride in the same car, ridesharing is an effective way to reduce the number of cars on the road, resulting in reduced traffic congestion. Ridesharing services, such as Uber and Lyft, are increasingly popular and allow people to easily and conveniently find a ride to their destination.
 
 Electric scooters and skateboards
 
 Electric scooters and skateboards are becoming increasingly popular in cities around the world as an alternative form of transportation. These vehicles are compact and easy to store, allowing commuters to take them with them on public transport or store them in their office or home. Additionally, electric scooters and skateboards are emission-free, making them a great way to reduce air pollution.
 
 Conclusion
 
 In conclusion, traffic congestion is a major problem in many cities around the world. While public transport systems can play an important role in alleviating this problem, there are other alternative forms of transport that can be used to help reduce traffic congestion. Bicycle lanes, ridesharing services, and electric scooters and skateboards can all help to reduce the number of cars on the road and provide commuters with a convenient and eco-friendly way to get from one place to another.";62;2507;1862;2529;2195.5
31;31;essay32.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/giving-aid-poorer-countries-has-more-negative-effects-than-18453/;Giving aid to poorer countries has more negative effects than positive effect;"In this world, there is no one who does not know this world 'globalization', which means the world are more closer, and every single countries affects each other more than before in many ways. That is why governmental and non-governmental organizations have been focus on being harmony and contribute to aid to poor countries. It is true that just giving aid to impoverished countries could be manipulated by big power countries. In addition, a great amount of materials and money have poor countries being corrupted and politically dependent on other countries.
 However, I agree that aiding poor countries has positive effects, overweighing its side-effects for the several reasons.
 First of all, poor counties suffer from shortage of basic materials and facilities to start businesses and make it richer. To be out of poverty, it is fundamental to support basic industry related factors such as light, electricity, load, highways, natural resources, technology and buildings for companies. Aiding help poor countries in this situation solve their economical problems and run their own business. In actual, republic of Korea used to be the poorest country even compared to others in Africa in 1960's. Now that it has became strong economy country aiding poor countries after 10 years of aid from other counties.
 Secondly, aiding campaign gives a chance to considerate about poor people. If people in rich countries ponder poor people suffering from poverty and diseases, they would never take their abundance for granted. It not only raises the notice the meaning of harmony and love, but also be a good chance to learn humane doctrine of globalization.
 Third, the campaigns might include practical benefits. In globalized world, the economies of several countries are in a big network and must influence on each others. When America mortgage loan system went bad, several economies of European and Asian countries fluctuated, even any countries had to be gotten international supports to block its bankrupt.
 In conclusion, there are abovementioned three key points of positive effects of aid; supporting poor countries to make its economy strong and building humane concepts to people, keeping strong global economy. I strongly believe that being a global neighbor by aiding poor countries would be continues by many organizations and volunteers, and it will make the earth a better place to live.
";"Giving aid to poorer countries has more negative effects than positive effects.
 
 The idea of providing aid to poorer countries is a noble one, as it is intended to help those in need. However, the reality is that giving aid to poorer countries often has more negative effects than positive ones. This is due to a variety of factors, including corruption, lack of accountability, and the fact that aid often does not reach those who need it most.
 
 One of the most significant negative effects of giving aid to poorer countries is the issue of corruption. In many cases, the aid money is not used for its intended purpose, but instead is siphoned off by corrupt officials and used for their own personal gain. This means that the money is not going to those who need it most, and instead is being used to line the pockets of those in power. This can lead to a further entrenchment of poverty and inequality, as those who are already in power are able to use the aid money to further their own interests.
 
 Another negative effect of giving aid to poorer countries is the lack of accountability. In many cases, the aid money is not tracked or monitored, meaning that it is difficult to know where it is going and how it is being used. This can lead to a situation where the money is not being used for its intended purpose, and instead is being misused or wasted. This can lead to a further entrenchment of poverty and inequality, as those who are already in power are able to use the aid money to further their own interests.
 
 Finally, giving aid to poorer countries can also have a negative effect on the local economy. In many cases, the aid money is used to purchase goods and services from foreign countries, meaning that the money is not staying in the local economy. This can lead to a situation where the local economy is not able to develop and grow, as the money is not being used to create jobs or stimulate economic activity.
 
 In conclusion, giving aid to poorer countries has more negative effects than positive ones. This is due to a variety of factors, including corruption, lack of accountability, and the fact that aid often does not reach those who need it most. It is important to be aware of these negative effects, and to ensure that aid is used in a way that is beneficial to those who need it most.";"Giving aid to poorer countries has been an ongoing practice of many of the worlds wealthy nations for decades. While the aid has been given with the intention of bettering the lives of the people living in these countries, the reality is that giving aid to poorer countries may have more negative effects than positive effects.
 
 One of the major negative effects of giving aid to poorer countries is the potential for donor nations to use the aid as a means of controlling countries political and economic agendas. Aid can be given conditionally, with the donor nation making demands that the recipient nation must comply with in order to receive aid. For example, a donor nation may require that certain businesses be opened or closed and that certain infrastructure projects be completed in order for the recipient nation to receive aid. The result of these conditional demands is that the recipient nations policies become tied to the donor nations agenda, instead of the recipient nation itself being able to pursue its own agenda.
 
 Another major negative effect of giving aid to poorer countries is that it can create a dependency on the aid. If a country relies too heavily on outside aid, then its own people will lack the incentive to take responsibility for their own development and economic growth. In addition, aid can also lead to economic stagnation because the recipient country will be unable to stimulate growth or build its own economic infrastructure without assistance from outside sources.
 
 Finally, giving aid to poorer countries can have a long-term negative cultural effect, as the influx of foreign aid can lead to the erosion of the recipient countrys traditional ways of life and culture. Foreign aid can bring with it more modern values, technology, and consumer goods, which may disrupt the countrys traditional way of life. This can lead to a breakdown of traditional values and culture, making it more difficult for the countrys people to carry on practices that were once essential to its way of life.
 
 In conclusion, while giving aid to poorer countries can have some positive short-term effects, there are more negative effects that should be taken into account. Donor nations should be aware of the potential dangers of giving aid, and they should ensure that any aid given is done so in a way that does not disrupt or undermine the recipient countrys traditional values and way of life.";77;2405;2327;2430;2378.5
32;32;essay33.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/effects-globalization-decrease-global-tension-18439/;effects of globalization (decrease in global tension);"During the history of the world, every change has its own positive and negative sides. Globalization as a gradual change affecting all over the world is not an exception. Although it has undeniable effects on the economics of the world; it has side effects which make it a controversial issue.
 Some people prefer to recognize globalization as a threat to ethnic and religious values of people of their country. They think that the idea of globalization put their inherited culture in danger of uncontrolled change and make them vulnerable against the attack of imperialistic governments.
 Those who disagree, believe that globalization contribute effectively to the global improvement of the world in many aspects. Developing globalization, people can have more access to many natural resources of the world and it leads to increasing the pace of scientific and economic promotions of the entire world. In addition, they admit that globalization can be considered a chance for people of each country to promote their lifestyle through the stuffs and services imported from other countries.
 Moreover, the proponents of globalization idea point out globalization results in considerable decrease in global tension due to convergence of benefits of people of the world which is a natural consequence of globalization.
 In conclusion, I would rather classify myself in the proponents of globalization as a speeding factor of global progress. I think it is more likely to solve the problems of the world rather than intensifying them.
";"Globalization has had a profound effect on the world in many ways, one of which is a decrease in global tension. Globalization is the process of increased interconnectedness between countries, cultures, and economies. It has been driven by advances in technology, communication, and transportation, allowing for increased trade, investment, and cultural exchange.
 
 The decrease in global tension that has come with globalization is due to the increased interconnectedness between countries. This has led to increased understanding and cooperation between nations, as well as a greater sense of shared responsibility. As countries become more interconnected, they are more likely to work together to solve global problems, such as climate change, poverty, and terrorism. This cooperation has led to a decrease in global tensions, as countries are more likely to work together to resolve conflicts and disputes.
 
 Globalization has also led to increased economic integration between countries. This has allowed for increased trade and investment, which has resulted in increased economic growth and development. This economic growth has led to increased stability and prosperity, which has in turn led to a decrease in global tensions.
 
 Finally, globalization has led to increased cultural exchange between countries. This has allowed for increased understanding and appreciation of different cultures, which has led to a decrease in global tensions. As countries become more interconnected, they are more likely to respect and appreciate each others cultures, which has led to a decrease in global tensions.
 
 In conclusion, globalization has had a profound effect on the world, one of which is a decrease in global tension. This decrease in global tension is due to increased interconnectedness between countries, increased economic integration, and increased cultural exchange. As countries become more interconnected, they are more likely to work together to solve global problems, which has led to a decrease in global tensions.";"Globalization has had some promising effects in the area of global tension. This is due to the increase in global interdependence, the spread of democratic ideals and processes, the underlying commitment to human rights, and the proliferation of free trade agreements.
 
 The increasing interdependence of the global economy has caused nations to become more interconnected. This has led to a greater understanding of each nation's interests, and because of this countries are more willing to work together for mutually beneficial agreements. This helps to reduce global tensions as countries are more likely to cooperate with one another instead of engaging in conflict.
 
 The spread of democratic ideals has also been a significant factor in the decreased global tensions. Democratic nations are less likely to engage in wars, as their citizens are more likely to support diplomatic solutions instead of military ones. This has been the case in the Middle East; the spread of democracy has helped to bring peace to the region.
 
 The commitment to human rights has also been a factor in the decrease in global tension. The global community has become more aware of the injustices and suffering that can befall individuals due to oppressive regimes. This has led to nations working together to promote human rights and to take action against oppressive regimes. For example, the United Nations has launched campaigns to protect human rights in countries such as Myanmar and Zimbabwe.
 
 Finally, the proliferation of free trade agreements has had a major impact on global tension. These agreements promote economic growth and help to create jobs, which in turn reduces the likelihood of military conflict. They also help to foster cooperation between nations as they are based on mutual benefit. This cooperation further reduces international tensions as countries are more likely to agree to peaceful resolutions instead of entering into military conflict.
 
 In conclusion, globalization has had a positive impact on global tension as it has increased interdependence, spread democratic ideals, increased commitment to human rights, and fostered trade. These changes have resulted in increased cooperation between nations and lessened the likelihood of military conflict. As a result, the world is a safer place today than it was before the rise of globalization.";53;1532;2037;2367;2202.0
33;33;essay34.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/study-school-get-job-18405/;Study at school or get a job?;"Many people believe that children should study at school to have more knowledge that prepare better for their future. Others, however, think that these children may disrupt their school work and should be allowed to leave school early to find a job. Personally, I tend to agree with the point of view that student have to be forced to study at school.
 First of all, schools offer to students a good environment with experienced professors and high quality programs for studying. It creates the best conditions for students education and can force them to focus on their school work instead of wasting their time to do useless things. Second of all, schools provide lots of academic knowledge to students. Students may learn professional skills, expand their understandings and gain experiences. Therefore, they have more opprotunities to find a job and to be successful in the future. For example, as we know, employer always prefer to hire an employee of high degree who have professional skills.
 Nevertheless, it is not unreasonable that some people think that children should interrupt their school work and get a job. Whether children can learn a lot at school, there are many subjects that will be of little value to them in the future. Furthermore, children can learn social skills when they have a job. They can get more experiences that can not be obtained at school. Working helps children be more independent and teach them to esteem and manage the money that they've earned.
 Overall, I believe that students should study at school. Even though there are some advantages of leaving school to find a job, studying at school is always the best choice for children's future. There are many ways that can train children to learn independent and social skills instead of getting a job.
";"The decision of whether to study at school or get a job is a difficult one for many young people. On the one hand, studying at school can provide a person with the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in the future. On the other hand, getting a job can provide a person with the financial means to support themselves and their family. Ultimately, the decision of whether to study at school or get a job should be based on a persons individual circumstances and goals.
 
 For those who are able to attend school, there are many benefits to doing so. Studying at school can provide a person with the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in the future. A person can gain a better understanding of the world around them, as well as the skills necessary to succeed in their chosen field. Additionally, studying at school can provide a person with the opportunity to network and make connections that can be beneficial in the future.
 
 For those who are unable to attend school, getting a job can provide a person with the financial means to support themselves and their family. A job can provide a person with the money necessary to pay for basic necessities, such as food and shelter. Additionally, a job can provide a person with the opportunity to gain valuable work experience and develop skills that can be beneficial in the future.
 
 Ultimately, the decision of whether to study at school or get a job should be based on a persons individual circumstances and goals. For those who are able to attend school, the benefits of doing so can be invaluable. For those who are unable to attend school, getting a job can provide a person with the financial means to support themselves and their family. No matter which path a person chooses, it is important to remember that both options can lead to a successful future.";"From the moment we are born we are asked the same question: what do you want to be when you grow up? Most of us take this to mean; what kind of job would you like to do when you are an adult? While this is true there is another, equally important question; how will you get there? Study at school or get a job?
 
 The two choices of study at school or get a job can seem daunting and similar but they differ in many ways.  Those that choose to study at school are taking the traditional route of completing a secondary level of education and then university. This route can be expensive and for many stymied by the cost of tuition. It is also a lengthy process that typically takes 3-5 years after high school to complete. This can be a significant barrier to those attempting to enter the work force quickly, especially in times of economic downturn. 
 
 On the other hand, those that choose the path of getting a job directly, are able to enter the work-force faster and with the benefit of hands on experience. While employment opportunities can be scarce during economic downturns, many jobs still exist and workers receive on the job training that can be invaluable. Plus, earnings can provide much needed financial relief should tuition bills start to rack up.
 
 Ultimately, the decision of study at school or get a job should not be taken lightly but rather seen as part of a larger strategy. It is important to weigh the costs and benefits associated with both options to determine what is best for you. Those that seek to gain a specific skill set, such as in engineering, may find that the traditional route is more beneficial while those that want to experience a range of opportunities within the workplace may find great success in the route of getting a job. Whichever option you choose, it is important to understand that investing in yourself is always a good decision.";29;1794;1825;1886;1855.5
34;34;essay35.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/essay-high-sales-reflect-power-advertising-not-real-need-17906/;High sales reflect Power of Advertising and not the Real Need;"Nowadays, we can see advertisements everywhere, from television set to posters on the streets. Some people believe that these various advertisements get people to buy products that are unnecessary and only look good on television. I tend to agree with this view.
 To boost their sales and win over customers, companies pour a great amount of money into advertising. Most of the time, it is not about the function or quality of the commodities themselves but really the promotion of the good feeling of possessing the product. By which I mean, huge cooperation hire celebrities as the face of their product. By casting famous singers in their television advertisement, motorcycles or clothes for example, sales increase significantly since youngsters, as the target consumers, love celebrities. Since having these products shows their status, the quality obviously is not relatively important.
 However, despite the fact that advertisements can be falseful and exaggerated, it is also true that it plays and important role economically. They introduce new products, and provide various choices, not to mention they are often visually enjoyable, since they aim to grab your attention. Advertising also helps to keep prices at reasonable levels, creates a fair environment for commercial competition. Otherwise the market may be monopolistic, and the price as well as the choice will not be so selective.
 The power of advertising maybe over-rated, we can not deny that the final decision is on the hands of us consumers. No matter how appealing the advertisements are, we should be able to make the decision on our own.
";"Advertising is a powerful tool that can be used to influence consumer behavior. It is used to create demand for products and services, and to increase sales. While it is true that advertising can be effective in increasing sales, it is important to recognize that it is not always an accurate reflection of the real need for a product or service.
 
 Advertising can be used to create a false sense of need for a product or service. Companies often use persuasive tactics to make consumers believe that they need a product or service, even if they do not actually need it. This can lead to people buying products or services that they do not actually need, and can lead to overconsumption.
 
 Advertising can also be used to create a false sense of urgency. Companies often use time-limited offers and discounts to encourage people to buy products or services quickly. This can lead to people making impulse purchases that they may later regret.
 
 Advertising can also be used to manipulate peoples emotions. Companies often use emotional appeals to make people feel like they need a product or service. This can lead to people buying products or services that they do not actually need, or that are not the best value for their money.
 
 Finally, advertising can be used to create a false sense of exclusivity. Companies often use limited-time offers and exclusive deals to make people feel like they need to buy a product or service quickly. This can lead to people making purchases that they may later regret.
 
 While it is true that advertising can be effective in increasing sales, it is important to recognize that it is not always an accurate reflection of the real need for a product or service. Advertising can be used to manipulate peoples emotions and create a false sense of need, urgency, and exclusivity. As a result, high sales can be a result of effective advertising, rather than a reflection of the real need for a product or service.";"The power of advertising has long been a source of debate. On one hand, it is clear that advertising can help boost sales of goods and services, but is it true that high sales only reflect the power of advertising and not the real need for a product or service? This essay will explore both sides of the argument and provide a conclusion.
 
 Advertising can be seen as a powerful tool for a business to use. It is a form of communication that can be used to create awareness about products or services. Advertising is an effective way of creating customer demand for products and services. It can be used to target specific audiences and help to capture their attention. By creating a sense of urgency and creating an emotional connection with the customer, advertising can help to spur customer action. As such, when a product is advertised heavily, it is likely that there will be an increase in sales, regardless of whether or not there is a real need for the product or service.
 
 On the other hand, it could be argued that high sales are reflective of the real need for the product or service. As advertising is used to create awareness, it is likely that this will lead to increased sales if there is a real need for the product or service. It is also possible that advertising helps to build brand loyalty and reinforce the need for the product or service. Thus, advertising can be seen as a factor in the success of a product or service, but it is not the fundamental factor in successful sales.
 
 In conclusion, it is clear that advertising can be a powerful tool for a business to increase sales. There is no doubt that it can help to create the customer demand for a product or service. However, it is also important to consider that high sales can also be reflective of the real need for a product or service and not just the power of advertising. Therefore, it is essential that businesses consider both factors when looking to increase sales.";61;1618;1953;1958;1955.5
35;35;essay36.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/essay-gun-contral-17874/;Gun control;"Gun is definitely not a kind of normal good in our society, which is strictly controlled in most countries. However, gun control in some countries is relatively loose than others. Therefore, this is still a controversial topic around the world. From my point of view, it is sensible to enforce the gun control.
 The first factor considered is the risk of accidents with guns. The accidents cannot be completely avoided although only those who have gun licenses can purchase guns. For example, we hear some news from time to time that someone was hurt by accident during the hunting. So the fewer guns possessed, the fewer accidents would happened, our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates.
 Secondly, most violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns, especially in some countries where guns are available for people. Eventually, guns will create a violent society if the trend continues. Take an example, in American, young adults and even juveniles can get access to guns, which leads to the tragedies of school gun shooting. What is worse, some terrorists are able to possess more advanced weapons than the police, which makes citizens always live in danger.
 Thirdly, the possession of guns can also raise the rates of suicide. In the US, firearms remain the most common method of suicide, accounting for about 50 per cent. Unfortunately, there is an increasing trend of adolescent suicides and suicides among those age 75 and over.
 In conclusion, considering the rise in accident rates, violent crime rates and suicide rates, I support that the guns should be strictly limited and the government should enforce a series of laws to prevent our societies from violence.
";"Gun control is a highly debated topic in the United States. It is a controversial issue that has been around for decades and continues to be a major issue in the United States. Gun control is the regulation of the manufacture, sale, possession, and use of firearms. The purpose of gun control is to reduce the number of firearms in circulation, reduce the number of gun-related deaths, and reduce the number of gun-related crimes.
 
 Proponents of gun control argue that it is necessary to reduce the number of firearms in circulation in order to reduce the number of gun-related deaths and gun-related crimes. They argue that gun control will reduce the availability of firearms to criminals, thereby reducing the number of gun-related crimes. They also argue that gun control will reduce the number of accidental shootings, as well as suicides, by making it more difficult for people to obtain firearms.
 
 Opponents of gun control argue that it is an infringement on the Second Amendment right to bear arms. They argue that gun control will not reduce the number of gun-related deaths or gun-related crimes, as criminals will still find ways to obtain firearms. They also argue that gun control will not reduce the number of accidental shootings or suicides, as people will still find ways to obtain firearms.
 
 The debate over gun control is complex and highly charged. It is a difficult issue to resolve, as both sides have valid points. However, it is clear that gun control is necessary in order to reduce the number of gun-related deaths and gun-related crimes. It is also clear that gun control should be implemented in a way that respects the Second Amendment right to bear arms. Ultimately, it is up to the citizens of the United States to decide what type of gun control is necessary and how it should be implemented.";"Gun control has been a pressing issue in the contemporary world. With the rise in mass shootings and gun-related crimes, it has become increasingly important to discuss gun control as an effective way to reduce such acts of violence and protect innocent citizens from potential harm. Gun control advocates have suggested various solutions, such as prohibiting certain types of firearms, instituting comprehensive background checks, and instituting systems to track firearms for better regulation. In contrast, the National Rifle Association (NRA) and other gun rights groups have argued that gun control does not reduce gun-related crime, and that it would be an infringement on their Second Amendment rights. 
 
 Proponents of gun control have valid arguments. The United States has the highest rate of gun ownership in the world, yet also has one of the highest rates of gun-related deaths. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the rate of firearm-related deaths has been on the rise since 2015. Furthermore, studies have shown that states with stricter gun control laws have lower rates of gun-related homicides. Therefore, it is clear that stricter gun control measures are needed to reduce gun-related deaths and keep citizens safe.
 
 On the other hand, opponents of gun control have their own points to make. They argue that the Second Amendment grants them the right to bear arms. They believe that gun control measures would prevent citizens from exercising their right to self-defense, and that criminals would still find ways to obtain firearms regardless of the laws in place. Some opponents also argue that the root causes of gun-related violence are poverty, mental illness, and a lack of education, and that gun control does not address these issues.
 
 Overall, gun control is an important and complex issue. It is clear that gun control is necessary to reduce gun-related deaths, and keep citizens safe. However, it is important that any gun control measure should not infringe upon the Second Amendment rights of citizens. The best solution is to find a way to balance gun control with the right to bear arms, and ensure that guns are used in responsible and safe ways.";11;1694;1830;2207;2018.5

By competing in a sporting event, countries can show their commitment to peaceful competition and demonstrate their respect for each other. This can help to create a sense of unity and understanding between countries and can help to reduce tensions between them.
 
 In conclusion, international sporting events can help to ease international tensions by providing a platform for countries to come together and compete in a friendly and peaceful manner. They can also help to promote understanding and respect between different cultures and can help to promote peace and stability in the world. Therefore, international sporting events are an important tool for easing international tensions.";"Sports have long been considered a way to bring people together and cultivate peace in a fractured world. Sporting events at a global level have the potential to be a force for good and promote unity. International sporting occasions have emerged as a powerful tool to ease international tensions, promote understanding, and create a bridge between countries.
 
 International events such as the Olympic and Paralympic Games, the World Cup and other major sporting competitions create a platform for countries to come together, compete, and showcase their talent. These events provide an opportunity for nations to come together and build relationships, fostering an attitude of mutual respect and understanding. Sports provide an environment in which all participants can embrace their national pride and, at the same time, celebrate each others achievements. A study by the Oxford Institute for Economics and International Studies showed that countries with a successful team at the Olympics experienced a 47 percent reduction in the risk of conflict and civil war.
 
 Sporting occasions have also worked to challenge negative stereotypes about different nations and cultures. By bringing together people from different backgrounds and countries, international sports have a far-reaching effect of breaking down the walls of mistrust and prejudice. This is especially true for people in the developing world, where access to international travel and communication is limited. Sporting events can create a platform for dialogue and collaboration, building a nuanced understanding of diverse cultures and providing potential for future partnerships.
 
 In addition to promoting peace, international sporting events can also serve as a vehicle for diplomacy. Sports diplomacy has been used as a tool by governments and international organizations to address issues such as conflict resolution, human rights and development. Events such as the Olympics, with international representation and media coverage, can be used to draw attention to global issues such as poverty reduction and environmental protection. In this way, global sports events are utilized as a tool to create change and foster positive communication between countries.
 
 In summary, international sporting occasions are a powerful tool for easing international tensions and fostering connections between countries. By coming together to compete and celebrate, events such as the World Cup, the Olympics and other major competitions create a platform for countries to challenge negative stereotypes, build mutual understanding, and promote peace and diplomacy.";68;2101;1860;2627;2243.5
37;37;essay38.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/graduate-essays-4/essay-technology-widen-gap-between-rich-poor-21056/;technology that widen the gap between rich and poor?;"Technology, in the past two hundred years, has taken a dramatic progress in many fields of our society, such as telecommunications, manufacturing and buildings, etc. Certainly, technologies have also contributed to the great change of our daily lives. However, today some people consider that the range of technology regarding of public has a negative effect on increasing the gap between rich and poor. Personally, I find it hard for me to agree with this opinion by the following reasons.
 In the first instance, the progress of material technology leads to the sharp fall of price of a great number of products. About ten years ago, mobile phones ware very expensive for most members of my country, only a few of rich individuals have enough money to buy one. Today, mobile phones become a common one of household items, which due to the cheaper materials and better producing technologies. Thus, most members of our society can benefit from the consequences of technical advancements, especially the poor people.
 Secondly, technical developments improve productivity, which help people to escape from daily chores, and invest more time and energy in studying and living a more meaningful life. With the development of Internet, we can enjoy the pleasure and conveniences which it brings about for us every day. In the past time, we had to spend a lot of time searching information and waiting for letters of our friends who lived far away from us. Nowadays, we can talk with our friends online, no matter where we are and how far between us. In addition, the Internet gives everyone access to the same information, this therefore leads to greater equality between individuals.
 Undoubtedly, everything has two sides and technology is not an exception. To some extent, the gap between rich people and poor is widen by technology, because only the rich people have ability to afford the expensive high-tech products, and these products can help them to earn more in return.
 Nevertheless, I think it is a limp opposition to the remarkable advantages of technology, and technology is not the root cause of the gap.
 In conclusion, the good technology bringing to us is undeniable. Under proper use of technology, the human being can be benefit a lot and perpetually from the advancement of it.
";"Technology has been a great boon to humanity, but it has also widened the gap between the rich and the poor. The rich have access to the latest technology and can use it to their advantage, while the poor are left behind.
 
 The digital divide is a major factor in this gap. The digital divide is the gap between those who have access to the internet and technology and those who do not. This divide is often seen between the rich and the poor, as the rich have the resources to access the latest technology, while the poor are often left behind.
 
 The digital divide has had a major impact on the economy. The rich have access to the latest technology and can use it to their advantage, while the poor are left behind. This has led to an increase in inequality, as the rich are able to use technology to increase their wealth, while the poor are unable to do so.
 
 Technology has also had an impact on the job market. The rich have access to the latest technology and can use it to their advantage, while the poor are often left behind. This has led to an increase in unemployment, as the rich are able to use technology to find better jobs, while the poor are unable to do so.
 
 Technology has also had an impact on education. The rich have access to the latest technology and can use it to their advantage, while the poor are often left behind. This has led to an increase in educational inequality, as the rich are able to use technology to get better education, while the poor are unable to do so.
 
 Overall, technology has widened the gap between the rich and the poor. The rich have access to the latest technology and can use it to their advantage, while the poor are often left behind. This has led to an increase in inequality, unemployment, and educational inequality. It is important to address this issue and ensure that everyone has access to the same technology, so that everyone can benefit from it.";"In a world that is ever-evolving and advancing, technology is becoming an increasingly integral part of everyday life. It is used to make life easier and more enjoyable, and it is often seen in the hands of the wealthy. Technology can also be used to enhance one's education, gain access to information, and remain connected to the world. However, this widespread access and usage of technology can also widen the gap between the rich and the poor, as those with a lower income often cannot afford the same access to the same technologies.
 
 One of the main ways that technology has widened the gap between the rich and the poor is in terms of access. The Internet and digital technologies are playing an increasingly important role in our lives and offer a variety of opportunities such as learning, communication, entertainment, and business. The issue is that not everyone has the same access to these technologies. The cost for digital access can be quite expensive, and those with low incomes may not be able to afford the access to these opportunities. This means that those with a lower income will be unable to access the same information, education, and business opportunities as those who can afford to have access to the internet. This lack of access often leads to a widening of the gap between the have and have-nots in terms of resources and opportunities available to them.
 
 Furthermore, technology can also limit the amount of money that lower-income individuals can make. As technology advances and new techniques are developed to make tasks more efficient, those with access to the resources and knowledge to utilize these techniques will have an advantage over those who do not have access. This often means that those with a lower income who rely on manual labour as their primary income source are left at a disadvantage as machines become more cost-effective and efficient means of production. This can lead to an even greater widening of the gap between the rich and the poor.
 
 In conclusion, it is clear that in this day and age, technology can widen the gap between the rich and the poor. Access to digital technologies can be costly, and it can also lead to a lack of access to resources and opportunities available to those with a higher income. Furthermore, technological advancements can also limit the effectiveness of manual labour and provide an advantage to those with access to new production techniques. All of this contributes to a widening of the gap between the rich and the poor and highlights the importance of finding ways to provide access to those who would not be able to afford it.";52;2296;1919;2631;2275.0
38;38;essay39.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/why-should-human-beings-travel-outer-space-20952/;Why should human beings travel to outer space?;"For many centuries, outer space has been one of the most favourable realms of study. Space expeditions have been launched and many have been successful. However, a lot of people still consider space exploration as an act of wasting money, to illustrate, astronauts only brought useless rocks back to planet earth despite the large sum of money spent on their equipment. On the other hand, there are some reasons for human beings to travel to outer space.
 Firstly, many facts about solar system can be discovered. For instance, a picture of planet earth proved that the earth is round, not flat. Another example is that it is the earth which goes around the sun, not vice versa. If it was not for the space exploration, we would never know these facts.
 Secondly, people can know more about the planet earth itself. By observing planet earth from outer space, people can find out ample things for example about the atmosphere of the planet earth. With this knowledge, people can work on something to prevent earth hazards such as global warming.
 Finally, a great deal of sophisticated technology can be invented. As astronauts need to travel to outer space which does not have any oxygen to breathe in, scientists are compelled to do research on the oxygen tanks. Oxygen tanks, for instance, are proved useful not only in outer space but also underwater. Moreover, spaceships, communication satellites and space pens also contribute a lot to the society.
 As a conclusion, I personally think that human beings should travel to outer space. In spite of costing a fortune, space exploration has given aforementioned benefits.
";"Space exploration has been a topic of fascination for centuries, and the idea of humans travelling to outer space has been a dream of many. While there are many reasons why humans should travel to outer space, the most important reasons are to gain a better understanding of our universe, to search for new resources, and to further our knowledge of science and technology.
 
 First and foremost, travelling to outer space would give us a better understanding of our universe. By travelling to outer space, we would be able to observe and study the stars, planets, and other celestial bodies in a way that is not possible from Earth. We would be able to gain a better understanding of the universe and its origins, as well as the laws of physics that govern it. This knowledge would be invaluable in helping us to better understand our place in the universe and how we can best use our resources to benefit humanity.
 
 Second, travelling to outer space would allow us to search for new resources. With the depletion of natural resources on Earth, it is becoming increasingly important to find new sources of energy and materials. By travelling to outer space, we would be able to explore and search for new resources that could be used to benefit humanity. This could include the discovery of new minerals, energy sources, and even new forms of life.
 
 Finally, travelling to outer space would help us to further our knowledge of science and technology. By travelling to outer space, we would be able to conduct experiments and research that would not be possible on Earth. This would allow us to gain a better understanding of the laws of physics and how they apply to our universe. It would also allow us to develop new technologies and materials that could be used to benefit humanity.
 
 In conclusion, travelling to outer space is an important endeavor for humanity. It would allow us to gain a better understanding of our universe, search for new resources, and further our knowledge of science and technology. These reasons make it clear that travelling to outer space is an important and necessary step for humanity.";"As mankind looks to the stars and wonders what lies beyond our atmosphere, the idea of space travel has become ever more popular. From the earliest of times, scientists and dreamers alike have imagined an existence fully explored, and populated, by human beings. Space is an incredibly vast, mysterious and seemingly infinite expanse of the unknown. By navigating this unknown, science and technology could be pushed further than ever before, creating amazing possibilities for humanity. With the advancement of technology, space travel is now seen as a realistic possibility, leading to the question of why human beings should travel to outer space.
 
 
 
 Firstly, space travel can help to advance human knowledge and understanding. Visiting other planets and galaxies, and engaging in research, can give us a better understanding of the universe. Astronomical bodies, like comets and gas giants, provide us with invaluable insights about our own planet. The more information we gain about outer space, the better we can understand our place in the universe, and gain a better knowledge of our own earth. 
 
 
 
 Beyond knowledge, space travel is an incredible opportunity to explore and innovate. With each mission we complete, engineers and rocket scientists come closer to perfecting the technology behind space exploration. As these technologies continue to improve, we can gain a greater understanding of the unique properties of space, such as its lack of gravity, and begin to further design vehicles specifically for space exploration. By combining our current knowledge of physics with innovative engineering and a thirst for exploration, humanity can finally begin to reach its destination of a fully colonized outer space. 
 
 
 
 Finally, space travel can serve as a source of inspiration. What could be more inspiring than being able to view the universe from a new perspective? Visiting other galaxies and viewing new planets can be an incredibly humbling experience, providing a greater appreciation of the beauty of our own planet. As we embark further into the depths of space, humanity can gain a newfound appreciation of the natural wonders that lie beyond our atmosphere, and deepen its understanding of the importance of our own planet. 
 
 
 
 To conclude, space travel is an incredibly exciting opportunity to advance human knowledge, explore, innovate and be inspired. By travelling to outer space, we can gain a greater understanding of the universe and our place within it, push the boundaries of technology and science, and gain a newfound appreciation of our home planet. With the current advancements in technology and science, human space travel is finally becoming a possibility, and mankind can finally begin to explore beyond the stratosphere.";46;1625;2126;2778;2452.0

This phenomenon, although in some extents, are proved to have negative effects, I feel strongly that the disadvantages are far outweighed by the advantages. In this essay, some of the benefits surrounding this matter will be carefully explained.
 It is undoubtedly certain that students can gain their practical experience by getting involved extra jobs. Part-time jobs furnish them with precious chance to practice what they are learning at their universities. In addition, that seems to be more essential the present shortage of sufficiently practical conditions supplied in universities.

40;40;essay41.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/benefits-students-unpaid-work-20722/;Benefits of students' unpaid work;"The purpose of this essay is to discuss what can students and the organizations benefit from the activity that the students sent by their schools to work for companies without salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the advantages for doing this for both students and companies, and then I would draw a conclusion at the end.
 To begin with, students can learn invaluable experiences through the period of time working for the institutions they are assigned to. In most school curriculums, the courses are theoretical and often by instructors speaking to students sitting in the classroom. As a result, students might have little idea of the real challenges or the true situation when they enter the workforce after graduation. For this reason, the internship, although without pay, can give them the experiences that money cannot buy.
 As for the companies, the unpaid interns can no doubt save some money. In addition, the younger generations can help them generate new ideas as the students are not bound to restricted workload and they tend to have greater imagination, which can be essentially helpful when they are making a new advertisement or slogan. Moreover they can start looking for potential employees and begin the training, therefore save the time and resources for searching new staffs and organizing an orientation.
 To sum up, students can learn outside the textbook and classroom with a real working experiences that can be a great opportunity for future job consideration whereas organizations earn much more as they can not only save time and money but also be enlightened by what young people have to say.
";"In todays world, students are often encouraged to take on unpaid work as a way to gain valuable experience and to build their resumes. While this type of work may not provide a paycheck, there are many benefits to students who choose to take on unpaid work.
 
 One of the most obvious benefits of unpaid work is the opportunity to gain valuable experience. Students who take on unpaid work can learn a variety of skills that will be useful in their future careers. For example, students who volunteer at a local non-profit organization can learn how to work with a team, how to manage their time, and how to communicate effectively. These skills can be invaluable when it comes to finding a job after graduation.
 
 Another benefit of unpaid work is the chance to build a network of contacts. Students who take on unpaid work can meet people in their field of interest, which can be beneficial when it comes to finding a job. Additionally, students can use their unpaid work experience to demonstrate their commitment to their chosen field. This can make them more attractive to potential employers.
 
 Finally, unpaid work can provide students with a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. By taking on unpaid work, students can make a difference in their community and feel proud of their accomplishments. This can be a great source of motivation and can help students stay focused on their studies.
 
 In conclusion, there are many benefits to students who choose to take on unpaid work. Not only can they gain valuable experience and build a network of contacts, but they can also gain a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. For these reasons, unpaid work can be a great way for students to prepare for their future careers.";"Unpaid work can often be an often overlooked yet extremely beneficial part of a students life. Through unpaid work, college students can gain an assortment of valuable skills and knowledge, allowing them to stand out in the job market. The benefits of unpaid work for students come in many different forms, and are worth exploring.
 
 One of the most important benefits of unpaid work for students is the opportunity to gain general experience. In many cases, unpaid work can provide students with their first taste of the professional world and help them learn the basics of managing their time and resources. Unpaid work can also be used to gain a better understanding of a potential career path and determine if its the right fit for them. Students can gain insight into the organizational culture of a company and develop important skills such as teamwork and communication.

With an expansive network, students can be among the first to know about open positions and can make a lasting impression on employers.
 
 Moreover, unpaid work can increase self-confidence and build positive character traits. Working in a challenging environment can help students boost their self-esteem and become more confident in their abilities. Students will also learn important life lessons such as problem-solving and adapting to change, which will prove beneficial in finding successful solutions to their professional and personal challenges.
 
 Finally, unpaid work can provide students with the opportunity to hone their resume and make them stand out from the competition. Having unpaid work experience on their resume can help students stand out in an interview and demonstrate their commitment to the field. It can also provide them with practical knowledge which will help in their future job.
 
 Overall, students should strongly consider taking on unpaid work as it can help them stand out from the crowd and give them a competitive edge in the job market.

41;41;essay42.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/paying-more-money-only-motivation-make-employees-work-harder-20711/;Paying more money is the only motivation to make employees work harder;"The purpose of this essay is to discuss whether or not the only way to motivate employees to be more hard-working and productive is by raising their salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the factors for higher yields and finish by stating my position on this.
 A raise or a promotion can no doubt increase the morale in the working places. Workers understand they have to work harder to meet the boss' expectations and to make themselves worthwhile. For instance, junior high school teachers have great responsibility not only for students' private lives as they are going through adolescence but also their school work due to the fact that it is an important phase for them to study hard and get into the high school they want. If the teachers receive higher salaries, they will be willing to spend more extra time mentoring the youngsters rather than hoping they learn in cram schools and so forth, as this is what is happening in Taiwan.
 Nevertheless, I believe that creating an enjoyable working environment is more realistic and essential if one wishes an increase in productivity and better employee performances. Take Google for example, the company offers recreation rooms and extra personal leaves for their workers to develop a more relaxing and supportive workforce. By doing this, the employers can make sure the employees can actually focus and concentrate on their projects instead of thinking about their children or feeling pressured.
 To sum up, I believe that a higher pay can be one of the incentive if were to encourage harder-working employees. Alternatively, providing a more secured and relaxing environment for workers can fundamentally boost their productivity since they will be feeling more cared for and therefore do their best for their bosses.
";"Paying more money is often seen as the only way to motivate employees to work harder. While it is true that money can be a powerful motivator, it is not the only way to motivate employees. In fact, research has shown that there are many other ways to motivate employees that are more effective than simply offering more money.
 
 First, it is important to recognize that money is not the only thing that motivates employees. People are motivated by a variety of factors, including recognition, a sense of accomplishment, and the opportunity to learn and grow. When employees are given the opportunity to develop their skills and knowledge, they are more likely to be motivated to work harder. Additionally, when employees are given recognition for their hard work, they are more likely to feel valued and appreciated, which can lead to increased motivation.
 
 Second, offering more money can be counterproductive. If employees are given too much money, they may become complacent and not feel the need to work hard. Additionally, if employees are given too little money, they may become resentful and unmotivated. It is important to find the right balance between offering enough money to motivate employees and not offering too much money that could lead to complacency.
 
 Finally, it is important to recognize that money is not the only way to reward employees. Non-monetary rewards, such as flexible work hours, additional vacation time, or recognition for a job well done, can be just as effective as offering more money. These rewards can help to create a positive work environment and foster a sense of loyalty and commitment among employees.
 
 In conclusion, while money can be a powerful motivator, it is not the only way to motivate employees. There are many other ways to motivate employees, such as offering recognition, providing opportunities for growth, and offering non-monetary rewards. By recognizing the importance of these other forms of motivation, employers can create a more positive work environment and foster a sense of loyalty and commitment among their employees.";"The idea that paying more money is the only motivation to make employees work harder is a widespread one. On the surface, it makes sensethe more seriously an employer takes the financial well-being of their employees, the more likely they will be to push themselves to the limits of their abilities. However, this logic fails to take into account the many other forces that drive people to be productive and creativeforces that money alone cannot buy.
 
 At its core, motivation is an intrinsic force that drives a person toward a goal. While money can provide an external impetus to work harder, it cannot provide the internal resolve or commitment to make meaningful progress. This is because, at the end of the day, it is the individual who must bring forth their own determination and ambitionand no amount of money can guarantee that.
 
 In fact, relying solely on money as a motivator can often backfire. When employees feel as though their work is not being valued beyond their monetary compensation, it can lead to decreased effort and morale. Furthermore, depending too heavily on a pay raise to motivate employees can be an unsustainable approachat some point, an employer will simply run out of money to offer.
 
 The better approach is to provide various forms of recognition and reward. By taking time to recognize employees for their hard workboth financially and non-financiallyemployers create an environment in which employees feel appreciated and inspired. Examples of non-monetary recognition that can create a strong sense of motivation could include public recognition of achievements, awards, accolades, and even the occasional cup of coffee or lunch.
 
 Ultimately, paying employees more money can, indeed, have a tangible effect on their motivation to work harder. However, it is far from being the only tool availableand often time, it is not even the most effective one. Employers should take a holistic approach to employee motivation and recognize the importance of giving their employees a sense of respect and appreciation. When done correctly, this can create an environment of enthusiasm and dedication, no matter how much money is on the table.";70;1789;2093;2177;2135.0
42;42;essay43.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/sporting-events-easing-international-tensions-releasing-20060/;Sporting events easing international tensions, releasing patriotic feelings;"For most folks on Earth, the need to gather in one place, and enjoy competition with other talented people from different cultures through popular games has always been a strong motivation. This trend is so deeply engraved in people's mind that the organisation of such events continue to be planned, even when some participants are facing grievous social problems. It is agreed that large scale sports games make people focus on attractive contests instead of international disputes, and help them being proud of their nation. This will be proved by analysing how sports events may be an important link to the peace, and by how they encourage people to display their national symbols.
 Firstly, during times of war, people living in badly affected countries can forget about the gloomy environment and maintain a link with the rest of the world by listening to international sports event. For example, when Irak was hardly struck by the Second Gulf War, its citizens tried to catch any incoming news about the FootballWorld Cup through their portable receivers. This clearly shows that international sports competitions encourage people and put pressure on them to come back, sooner or later, to a relative peaceful normality. Thus, world sports events strongly participate in eventually pulling back people towards friendship and peace.
 Secondly, these sporting occasions are a good opportunity for people to be proud of their country. For instance, when the Football World Cup was organised in South Africa, its citizens filled up the stadiums, cheered and waved national flags to support their national team on the field. South African national and traditional songs were played in the streets throughout the night. This example demonstrates how people might take numerous elements from their roots and history to proudly display them while supporting their team. As a result, it is clear that people can freely express their patriotic feelings during international sports events.
 In conclusion, after analysing the effects of world games both for countries at war and for organising countries, it is clear that they not only constitute a tremendous appeal towards a peaceful society, but also guide the public demonstrations of national proudness. This has been true for centuries and will certainly not change in the foreseeable future.
";"Sporting events have long been a source of entertainment and a way to bring people together. In recent years, they have also become a powerful tool for easing international tensions and releasing patriotic feelings. This essay will explore how sporting events can be used to bridge divides between countries and foster a sense of national pride.
 
 The first way that sporting events can ease international tensions is by providing a platform for countries to come together in a peaceful and friendly manner. Through sports, countries can come together to compete in a friendly and respectful manner, allowing them to build relationships and foster a sense of understanding between them. This can be seen in the Olympic Games, which bring together athletes from all over the world to compete in a spirit of peace and camaraderie.
 
 Another way that sporting events can ease international tensions is by providing a platform for countries to express their national pride. Through sports, countries can show off their culture and values, allowing them to demonstrate their patriotism and national identity. This can be seen in the World Cup, which is a platform for countries to show off their national teams and express their pride in their country.
 
 Finally, sporting events can also be used to foster a sense of unity and solidarity between countries. Through sports, countries can come together to support a common cause, allowing them to build a sense of unity and solidarity between them. This can be seen in the World Cup, which brings together countries from all over the world to support their teams and show their support for their country.
 
 In conclusion, sporting events can be a powerful tool for easing international tensions and releasing patriotic feelings. Through sports, countries can come together to compete in a peaceful and friendly manner, express their national pride, and foster a sense of unity and solidarity between them. As such, sporting events can be an effective way to bridge divides between countries and foster a sense of national pride.";"Sporting events provide a unique platform that has been used throughout history to ease international tensions and to celebrate national pride. In the spirit of competition, countries are able to come together and build bridges between nations, cultures, and people around the world. Participating in a sporting event is an excellent way for people from different walks of life to come together and celebrate the progress of humanity.
 
 One of the most successful sporting events in the history of international diplomacy is the Olympic Games. This event has long been a symbol of peace and cooperation between all nations of the world. The Olympic Charter dictates that the Games are intended to promote a peaceful and better world by educating youth through sport practiced without discrimination of any kind and in the Olympic spirit, which requires mutual understanding with a spirit of friendship, solidarity, and fair play. The Olympic Games are an example of how sport can be used to promote peace and unity among nations, despite their differences.
 
 In addition to providing a platform for peace and unity, sporting events also cultivate a sense of national pride. People from all walks of life come together to cheer for their country and are united in a common cause by their citizens. The emotion and enthusiasm that accompanies a national sporting event can create a sense of national spirit and camaraderie among citizens, bridging together all levels of society. This passion and energy can propel a nation to overcome adversity and celebrate success, as seen when a unified nation celebrated their World Cup victory in 2018.
 
 To conclude, it is clear that sporting events have the unique ability to transcend international differences and release patriotic feelings in a constructive and positive way. The Olympic Games and other major sporting events are important forums to foster international understanding and to connect people around the world with a common purpose. Through such events, citizens can come together with a renewed sense of national pride, ready to celebrate success and overcome adversity as one.";75;2345;2076;2138;2107.0
43;43;essay44.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/government-should-make-more-effort-promote-alternative-19772/;Government should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy;"The increasing population and the technological advancements demand more energy than in the past. It is believed that there are various other resources such as the nuclear and solar which are abundant and eco-friendly. I will analyze these areas in the essay.
 Firstly, the major source of energy today is water. Although there is a lot of water shortage to generate electricity many countries still rely only on this source. To generate such a vast energy the fundamental resources are falling short. Thus, during summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India. If the government encourage the use of nuclear, solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity. Therefore, it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources.
 Secondly, the sources most widely used currently to generate power releases extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere which increases global warming. For example, the use of a solar cooker instead of an electric cooker would certainly reduce the global warming. In the same way, the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to the hydro-kinetic energy causes less atmospheric pollution.
 To conclude, it would be a better implication by the government to promote other sources of energy. This can make use of the available natural resources which in turn would reduce the global warming. Further, government should motivate and encourage the people to use alternative sources such as the solar and the nuclear energy.
";"In recent years, the world has become increasingly aware of the need to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels and to promote alternative sources of energy. Governments around the world have taken steps to promote the use of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and geothermal power. However, much more needs to be done if we are to make a real impact on the global energy crisis. Governments should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy in order to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and to protect the environment.
 
 One way in which governments can promote alternative sources of energy is through the use of incentives and subsidies. By providing financial incentives to businesses and individuals who invest in renewable energy sources, governments can encourage the development of these technologies and make them more accessible to the public. Governments can also provide subsidies to businesses that use renewable energy sources, making them more competitive in the market. This would help to reduce the cost of renewable energy and make it more attractive to consumers.
 
 Another way in which governments can promote alternative sources of energy is through the implementation of regulations and standards. By setting standards for the use of renewable energy sources, governments can ensure that these technologies are used in a safe and efficient manner. This would help to reduce the risk of accidents and environmental damage associated with the use of fossil fuels. Governments can also set regulations that require businesses to use renewable energy sources in order to reduce their carbon footprint.
 
 Finally, governments should also invest in research and development of alternative sources of energy. By investing in research and development, governments can help to create new technologies that are more efficient and cost-effective than existing ones. This would help to reduce the cost of renewable energy and make it more accessible to the public.
 
 In conclusion, governments should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy in order to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and to protect the environment. By providing incentives and subsidies, setting regulations and standards, and investing in research and development, governments can help to make renewable energy sources more accessible and cost-effective. This would help to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and to protect the environment for future generations.";"In the modern world of rising temperatures and increasing needs for energy, it is critical that governments make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy. Alternative sources of energy are those which do not involve burning fossil fuels, such as solar, wind, geothermal and hydro power. They provide clean and cost effective energy compared to traditional energy sources.
 
 The primary reason why governments should promote alternative sources of energy is because of the threat posed by climate change. Burning of fossil fuels for energy production emits carbon dioxide, one of the main greenhouse gases, leading to an increased risk of global warming and other climate issues. By reducing dependence on fossil fuels and instead relying on renewable sources of energy, this problem can be reduced. Furthermore, since these sources of energy often have a much lower cost of production, it can also help to reduce the cost of energy for consumers.
 
 Another reason why governments should promote alternative sources of energy is because of their potential for economic growth. Investing in alternative sources of energy can create jobs and spur economic growth in the regions where they are installed. Additionally, the cost of energy production can be reduced if alternative sources are adopted on a large scale, which can help to reduce energy bills for consumers.
 
 Finally, governments should promote alternative sources of energy because of their potential to help reduce poverty. In many developing countries, access to energy is still very limited, leading to increased poverty and lack of access to basic services. By providing access to alternative sources of energy, the economic prospects of these countries can be drastically improved.
 
 In conclusion, it is evident that governments should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy. This is due to the threat posed by climate change, potential for economic growth, and potential to reduce poverty. If governments are to effectively address these key issues, they need to prioritize alternative sources of energy.";75;1583;2497;2106;2301.5
44;44;essay45.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/gt-should-governments-responsible-help-unemployed-homeless-40169/;Should governments be responsible to help the unemployed and homeless;"Unemployment is clearly a global problem, be it in developed countries or developing ones. However, I tend to believe it is the responsibility of these disadvantaged citizens, rather than the government, to help them out.
 Government money should be spent on publicly benefitial programs only. Tax revenue is collected from those who works. Spending them on helping those not make contribution to society would not sound fair to tax payers. Besides, there are other pressing demands on the government expenditure, such as health care service and education, so addressing unemployment should have low priority.
 Also, it is obvious that, to survive in this competitive world, one has to work hard and equip themselves well. If they could get free financial help from the government, they might end up with out any motivation to work at all.
 Of course, this does not mean we should leave alone those who do need assistance. They are already in reverse circumstances and it would be rather difficult for them to overcome the difficulties without external support. In this case, the government ought to set up free vocational trainings or to provide interest-free bank loans for them, so that they can have the chance to get back to work. After all, it is benefitial to the society as a whole when the jobless can make contribution again.
 In conclusion, my point of view is that, although the government should provide help for the disadvantaged people, direct financial support may not be a wise option and people should rely on themselves to get out of the adversity.
";"The issue of unemployment and homelessness is a complex one that has been debated for many years. It is a problem that affects millions of people around the world, and it is one that governments must take seriously. The question of whether governments should be responsible for helping the unemployed and homeless is an important one, and it is one that deserves careful consideration.
 
 The first point to consider is that unemployment and homelessness are both serious issues that can have a devastating impact on individuals and their families. People who are unemployed or homeless are often unable to find work, and they may struggle to pay for basic necessities such as food and shelter. This can lead to a cycle of poverty and despair, and it is a situation that governments should be doing their best to prevent.
 
 The second point to consider is that governments have a responsibility to ensure that their citizens have access to basic needs such as food, shelter, and healthcare. This means that governments should be providing assistance to those who are unemployed or homeless. This could include providing job training and placement services, as well as providing access to affordable housing and other resources. Governments should also be working to create policies that will help to reduce unemployment and homelessness, such as increasing the minimum wage and providing tax incentives for businesses that hire people who are unemployed or homeless.
 
 Finally, it is important to recognize that helping the unemployed and homeless is not just a moral obligation, but it is also an economic one. When people are unemployed or homeless, they are unable to contribute to the economy, and this can have a negative impact on the overall health of the economy. By providing assistance to those who are unemployed or homeless, governments can help to stimulate the economy and create jobs.
 
 In conclusion, governments should be responsible for helping the unemployed and homeless. This is both a moral and economic obligation, and it is one that governments should take seriously. By providing assistance to those who are unemployed or homeless, governments can help to reduce poverty and create a healthier and more prosperous society.";"The issue of unemployment and homelessness is a challenging one for modern societies. While many people have the privilege of having a stable job and a home to live in, a significant portion of the population lacks these basic necessities. This can have a disastrous effect on individuals and societies as a whole, leading to an increase in poverty, crime, and other social ills. In light of this, governments should play a role in helping the unemployed and homeless.
 
 It is well documented that unemployment and homelessness can often lead to a cycle of poverty and social isolation. The lack of income can create financial struggles and mental health issues, while the lack of housing can create instability and lack of access to essential goods and services. This can result in physical and mental health problems, as well as difficulty accessing education and employment opportunities. As such, the government should use its resources to provide social support for those affected by unemployment and homelessness.
 
 The government can provide financial support to unemployed individuals and homeless families to help them meet their basic needs. This can be done through direct financial assistance or through public job programs that provide access to job training, education, and employment opportunities. Additionally, governments can provide resources to build and manage shelters and other facilities that help the homeless access basic goods and services, such as healthcare and housing.
 
 These measures can help reduce the effects of unemployment and homelessness, while also promoting economic growth. By providing access to employment opportunities, individuals can become more productive members of society and contribute to economic growth. Additionally, the economic activity generated by the construction and management of shelters for the homeless can also help stimulate local economies.
 
 In conclusion, governments should be responsible for addressing the issue of unemployment and homelessness. By providing financial support, job programs, and shelters, governments can help to reduce the suffering of those affected and promote economic growth. This can ensure that all members of society have access to basic necessities and the opportunity to engage in meaningful and productive employment.";69;1568;2250;2323;2286.5
45;45;essay46.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/true-function-university-essay-25755/;True Function of A University;"Universities have quickly become the places to go when people seek to further develop their expertise. Whether this really suits the needs of their potential employers is highly unlikely as universities nowadays have evolved as a domain of experts: where more and more is known about less and less. Nevertheless, among the vast range of choices offered there are often some training courses that have direct implications on job-seeking and other aspects in everyday life. However, although I respect the universities' aim of providing such courses to develop skills required for work and support their cause, I do not believe it is the main or best function of a university.
 A university, in common sense, is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge. What is meant by this is that students are the ones universities should really cater for, not the employers, as students are the ones here to seek knowledge. High school graduates choose to further educate themselves in universities because of all different reasons: a degree that's more widely accepted, gain knowledge and insight into an industry, or simply deepen their research interests in a certain field.
 On the other hand, universities and be regarded as institutions where abundant educational resources gather. It is, therefore, not necessary for a certain course or type of training to be offered to the students by a university, but instead, these must be made available when needed. So the truth lies somewhere closer to the fact that a university should provide access to information, rather than offer selected courses that are suitable for employers' taste.
 In conclusion, the main function of a university remains as the provision of knowledge and access to resources. It would be helpful, however, if certain courses concerning workplace skills can also be made available to students to help shape their futures.
";"The true function of a university is to provide a platform for students to gain knowledge and skills that will help them to become successful in their chosen field. A university provides a variety of educational opportunities, from traditional classroom instruction to hands-on learning experiences. Through these experiences, students can gain the knowledge and skills necessary to become successful in their chosen field.
 
 At a university, students can learn from experienced professors and professionals in their field. Through lectures, seminars, and other forms of instruction, students can gain a deeper understanding of their chosen field. This knowledge can be applied to their future career and help them to become successful.
 
 In addition to gaining knowledge, universities also provide students with the opportunity to develop their skills. Through internships, research projects, and other activities, students can gain practical experience in their chosen field. This experience can help them to become more competitive in the job market and better prepared for their future career.
 
 Finally, universities provide students with the opportunity to network with other students and professionals in their field. Through clubs, organizations, and other activities, students can build relationships with those in their field and gain valuable connections that can help them to succeed.
 
 In conclusion, the true function of a university is to provide students with the knowledge and skills necessary to become successful in their chosen field. Through lectures, internships, and other activities, students can gain the knowledge and experience necessary to become successful. Additionally, universities provide students with the opportunity to network with other students and professionals in their field, which can help them to build valuable connections that can help them to succeed.";"The true function of a university is to act as a platform for the exploration of knowledge and intellectual development. At the core of this mission, a university provides its students with the tools to think critically and independently, encouraging them to challenge their own beliefs and ideas in order to gain a better understanding of the world.
 
 Though, on the surface, many universities appear to be places that focus primarily on the teaching of traditional academic subjects, the truth is that they also provide a vast array of extra-curricular opportunities, such as student organizations, volunteer activities, and recreation, which can enhance and complement a students experience.
 
 The exploration of knowledge, however, is at the heart of the universitys mission. This can mean different things for different students. For some, it may involve studying a particular subject in great depth and gaining expertise in a field of study; for others, it may involve learning how to identify, analyze, and resolve complex problems and issues.
 
 At a university, students are also encouraged to look beyond the boundaries of traditional academic subjects and explore the arts and humanities, as well as the social sciences. The ability to understand and appreciate multiple disciplines can give students a richer, more developed understanding of the world around them.
 
 Finally, a university provides an opportunity for students to explore a wide range of options when it comes to their future careers. Through internships, networking events, and career counseling, universities can help students identify potential career paths and decide which field best suits their particular skills, interests, and aspirations.
 
 Ultimately, a universitys true function is not to merely deliver knowledge, but to foster intellectual growth, creativity, and independent thought. Through the exploration of knowledge, critical thinking skills, and a variety of extra-curricular activities, universities strive to create an environment in which all students can cultivate their individual potential and equip themselves with the skills and knowledge necessary to become life-long learners and leaders in the world.";29;1900;1901;2212;2056.5
46;46;essay47.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/essay-zoos-should-built-protect-rural-animals-agree-24423/;zoos should be built to protect rural animals;"Preserving wild animals in zoos is an issue which frequently generates a great deal of heated debate, with supporters maintaining that wild life would be taken good care from professionals, while opponents claim that the animals are deprived of freedom as a result of staying in zoos. From my perspective, animals should live in natural habitats instead of zoos.
 To begin with, it is the right of wild species to live in a environment away from human beings. Given the fact that human beings are responsible for the heavy pollution and severe damage to the natural habitats of many wild animals, it is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in. Apparently, the limited space and the artificial trees and lakes can not fully compensate the animals for their loss. Moreover, if rural animals are captured in the zoo for a long period, it would have negative influences on both the physical and psychological status of the creatures. As a result, the wild species would suffer from isolation and depression. It seems that zoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives.
 Nevertheless, supporters would argue that zoos, which are equipped with modern facilities and professionals, would provide better care for the animals inside. They further point out that the endangered species preserved in zoos would never die of illegal hunting. However, I would contend that the strict laws prohibiting poaching would provide a shelter for various kinds of animals in natural habitat. It seems that the growing number of natural habitat would be the ultimate solution of saving wild animals worldwide.
 By way of conclusion, it is my belief that wild animals should be set free from zoos not only because they have the right to enjoy freedom but they also escape from isolation and depression.
";"Zoos have long been a source of fascination and entertainment for people of all ages. They provide a unique opportunity to observe animals in their natural habitats and learn about their behavior and habits. However, in recent years, zoos have come under fire for their treatment of animals and their lack of conservation efforts. While some argue that zoos should be abolished, others believe that they can be used to protect rural animals from extinction.
 
 The main argument for building zoos to protect rural animals is that they provide a safe haven for species that are threatened by habitat destruction, poaching, and other human activities. Zoos can provide a secure environment for animals to live and breed, and can also be used to educate the public about the importance of conservation. Zoos can also be used to reintroduce species to the wild, which can help to restore balance to ecosystems that have been damaged by human activities.
 
 In addition to providing a safe haven for endangered species, zoos can also be used to conduct research on animal behavior and conservation. By studying animals in captivity, scientists can gain valuable insights into how animals interact with their environment and how to best protect them in the wild. This research can then be used to inform conservation efforts and help to protect rural animals from extinction.
 
 Finally, zoos can also be used to raise awareness about the importance of conservation and the need to protect rural animals. By providing educational programs and interactive exhibits, zoos can help to educate the public about the importance of protecting endangered species and the need to preserve their habitats. This can help to create a more informed and engaged public, which can lead to increased support for conservation efforts.
 
 In conclusion, zoos can be used to protect rural animals from extinction. They provide a safe haven for endangered species, can be used to reintroduce species to the wild, and can help to raise awareness about the importance of conservation. While some argue that zoos should be abolished, it is clear that they can be used for the greater good and should be built to protect rural animals.";"Zoos are institutions that are meant to conserve, breed, and protect wild animals for research and educational purposes. In this regard, it is essential that zoos should be built to protect rural animals.
 
 One of the major reasons why zoos should be established to protect rural animals is that they provide a safe haven for these animals. Rural animals, such as wild goats, deer, and other native mammals, face a variety of threats in their natural habitats, including habitat destruction, illegal hunting, and poaching. These animals may struggle to survive in their native habitats, and zoos can provide a safe and secure space for them. Zoos can also provide veterinary care and medical attention, which is essential to the survival of these animals. Furthermore, zoos can help increase their numbers by employing guided breeding programs.
 
 Secondly, zoos can help increase public awareness about rural animals and conservation efforts. Zoos can be used as educational centers, where visitors can learn about the issues facing rural animals and what can be done to help. Visitors can also learn about the various animal species, their habitats, and behavior. The increased knowledge and understanding of rural animals may help people appreciate these animals and become more inclined to take action to protect them.
 
 Finally, zoos also provide economic opportunities for rural communities. Zoos can draw visitors from other areas and help create jobs in the local economy. This could bring much-needed money to rural areas that may be struggling economically. In addition, zoos can also be used to promote local businesses, such as hotels and restaurants, which could help stimulate the local economy.
 
 In conclusion, zoos should be built to protect rural animals. They can provide a safe haven for rural animals, increase public awareness about conservation efforts, and create economic opportunities for rural communities. Therefore, zoos should be established and supported in order to ensure the health and wellbeing of rural animals.";45;1861;2205;2050;2127.5
47;47;essay48.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/essay-distance-learning-vs-attending-school-person-23759/;distance-learning vs. attending school in person;"A matter of considerable controversy at present is the issue of whether distance-learning should be promoted as much as possible, or rather attending lectures in person should be allowed to take a predominant place in universities because this way of learning is superior than online degrees. From my perspective, online-teaching should be widely used among colleges and universities in terms of convenience and optimizing cost for educational institutions.
 To begin with, distance-learning brings significant convenience for students in every corner of the world. In earlier times, students who were tired of commuting had to attend schools nearby, regardless of any differences in teaching facilities, teacher's qualifications or the school reputation. Now, however, students are able to apply for online-courses provided by top-of-the-range universities and colleges worldwide. Furthermore, the presence of video conferencing allows a teacher to teach a greater number of students. Consequently, educational institutions are able to optimize costs by increasing teacher-student ratios. Thanks to the economical online-teaching, universities and colleges are able to offer grants for students who have outstanding academic achievements but are unable to attend schools because of financial constrains.
 Nevertheless, opponents of online-degrees would argue that attending lectures in person provides students an opportunity to communicate with teachers and other classmates. They further point out that traditional teaching approaches involving discussion and cooperation among students play a significant role in campus life. It is the real interactions and communications in class make education much more attractive.
 By way of conclusion, it is my belief that distance-learning will become increasingly important in the future as the pace of life increases. However, discussions and interactions should be held via video conferencing frequently so that the joy of learning would not be diminished.
";"Distance-learning and attending school in person are two very different methods of education. Both have their own advantages and disadvantages, and it is important to consider both when making a decision about which one is best for a particular student.
 
 Distance-learning is a form of education that is conducted remotely, usually through the internet. It allows students to study from the comfort of their own home, and it can be more flexible than traditional schooling. Distance-learning can be a great option for students who are unable to attend school in person due to health or other personal reasons. It also allows students to work at their own pace and to take courses that may not be available in their local area.
 
 On the other hand, attending school in person has its own advantages. It allows students to interact with their peers and to learn in a more traditional setting. It also allows students to get a more hands-on experience with their studies, which can be beneficial for those who learn best through direct instruction. Additionally, attending school in person allows students to take advantage of extracurricular activities, such as sports and clubs, which can be beneficial for their overall development.
 
 Ultimately, the decision of which form of education is best for a particular student is a personal one. Distance-learning can be a great option for those who are unable to attend school in person, while attending school in person can be beneficial for those who learn best through direct instruction and extracurricular activities. It is important to consider both options and to make a decision that is best for the individual student.";"Distance-learning and attending school in person are both available options for students to pursue their educational endeavors. Each offers its own unique benefits, and both have their own advantages and disadvantages. It is up to the individual student to decide which option best suits their individual needs and expectations.
 
 When considering distance-learning, students will typically take advantage of the flexibility that this option provides. Many distance-learning programs are available online and provide students with the ability to manage their own pace and study material at their own convenience. As a result, this option can be great for individuals who are unable to attend classes during regular hours or who may have full-time work or family obligations. Additionally, the cost of a distance-learning program may be significantly lower than the cost of attending school in person.
 
 However, distance-learning does have some drawbacks. This option may not be suitable for all types of classes, especially those that require certain physical activities or hands-on experience for successful completion. Furthermore, distance-learning programs can lack the personal connection and educator feedback that an in-person program may provide. It can also be more difficult to stay motivated when studying from home, as there is no built-in structure or guidance from a professor or teacher.
 
 Attending school in person has its own benefits as well. For one, it can provide students with a more traditional educational setting where they can attend classes and learn from instructors on a regular basis. Additionally, being surrounded by other students can be beneficial for students who may enjoy the process of collaboration and active participation in the classroom environment. Moreover, attending school in person usually allows students to take part in extracurricular activities, such as sports, clubs, and community events, which further expand their educational experiences.
 
 However, just like distance-learning, attending school in person can have its own set of drawbacks. It can be difficult to balance school and work responsibilities, and commute times can increase significantly if the school is not located close by. Additionally, the cost of attending school in person may be higher than that of distance-learning, as there are often associated costs such as transportation and housing.
 
 In conclusion, deciding between distance-learning and attending school in person is a personal choice, and depends on the individual's needs and wants. Both options have their unique benefits and drawbacks, and it is important to make sure to consider both options before making a decision.";48;2005;1675;2716;2195.5
48;48;essay49.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/modern-communication-technologies-benefit-all-people-essay-23506/;Do modern communication technologies benefit all people;"Modern communication technologies such as mobile phones, e-mails and internet chat programs like the MSN Messenger have brought significant changes to our lives in recent years. Yet, there remains some disagreement as to whether the overall effect of this innovation has been positive or negative. Although there are valid arguments to the contrary, it is my belief that the majority of people in the globe have benefited greatly from these powerful and effective means of modern communication.
 To begin with, mobile phones and other tools of modern communication facilitate not only contact with friends and relatives in faraway places but also global business. With the click of a button, the vast amount of information can be transmitted from America to China in just a few seconds. Furthermore, it is generally felt that the access to these tools of communication is available in every corner of the world. With a mobile phone or a laptop, a person can talk or send messages online at a bus stop, in a corner shop or anywhere they could imagine. Therefore, it seems that these new forms of communication do bring a great deal of convenience to humankind.
 Nevertheless, opponents of modern communications claim that only the more privileged are able to enjoy the benefits. They further point out that the wide spread use of these efficient and effective ways of communication costs a considerable amount of money. Anyone who aims to use these innovations have to not only pay for the appliances such as a mobile phone or a computer but also cover up costs for communication services. Consequently, people who live in poverty are less likely to be benefited from modern communication technologies.
 By way of conclusion, I believe that modern communication technologies will benefit more people in the future as the pace of life increases; however, the have-nots cannot be ignored simply because they couldn't afford it.
";"In the modern world, communication technologies have become an integral part of our lives. From the internet to mobile phones, these technologies have revolutionized the way we communicate with each other. But do these technologies benefit all people equally?
 
 The answer to this question is both yes and no. On the one hand, modern communication technologies have made it easier for people to stay connected with each other, no matter where they are in the world. This has been especially beneficial for people who are separated by long distances, such as family members who live in different countries. It has also made it easier for people to access information and resources that were previously difficult to obtain.
 
 On the other hand, there are some people who are not able to benefit from modern communication technologies. For example, those who live in rural areas may not have access to the internet or mobile phones due to lack of infrastructure. This can limit their ability to stay connected with the rest of the world. Additionally, those who are unable to afford the latest technology may be left behind in terms of access to information and resources.
 
 Overall, modern communication technologies have had a positive impact on many peoples lives. However, it is important to recognize that not everyone is able to benefit from these technologies in the same way. It is therefore important to ensure that everyone has access to the same resources and opportunities, regardless of their location or financial situation.";"We have come a long way since the days of the Pony Express and the telegram. This old adage, which still rings true today, serves to remind us of the rapid advances in communication technologies we have witnessed over the course of the past century. Modern communication technologies, from the Internet to cellular networks, have revolutionized the ways in which people interact, share information and stay in touch. From utilizing social media to connecting with others in far-reaching locations, such advances have been especially beneficial in bridging the gap between people who are geographically distant from one another.
 
 Without a doubt, these developments have been profoundly beneficial to the global population. In particular, the advent of the Internet has made vast amounts of data infinitely more accessible to people all around the world. This affords them the opportunity to enhance their understanding of the world they inhabit by gathering and analyzing data from sources they may not have had access to in the past. Furthermore, individuals are able to acquire knowledge beyond what is provided to them in their own social circles or communities.
 
 For people living in developing countries without well-developed physical infrastructure, however, communication technologies may be their only source of access to the world beyond their boundaries. Social media and other digital resources are invaluable tools for improving educational opportunities, providing access to vital health information, and creating economic opportunities. Great strides have been made in these areas in part due to the ability of people to more easily connect and share with one another, and these advancements continue to grow.
 
 The ubiquity of modern communication technologies, however, has not necessarily benefited everyone equally. Those living in rural areas with inadequate infrastructure, for example, may not have adequate access to the Internet and other communication technologies. This can lead to disconnection from the world beyond their own locales, missing out on opportunities to socialize or access educational material or health information. Furthermore, it can exacerbate existing inequities in education, access to healthcare, and other social services.
 
 The potential of modern communication technologies is immense, and its capacity to revolutionize the way we interact with one another is ongoing. Its capacity to bridge the gap between people on different sides of the planet is unrivaled, and it has provided invaluable resources to those who lack access to such resources. However, its benefits are not unanimously shared across all populations due to persistent challenges in infrastructure and other factors. Therefore, it is important to ensure that everyone has access to modern communication technologies and that they are used to create equitable solutions to global problems.";55;1925;1538;2914;2226.0
49;49;essay50.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/essay-should-high-school-make-music-lessons-compulsory-23445/;Should high school make music lessons compulsory;"Most people claim that in high school music must be taught as a main subject, while others say that this is an unnecessary subject and should at least be optional. In this essay I will give my opinion for both sides.
 It is obvious that music has a great power which can positively influence on human being and its psychology. Therefore, many university authorities provide music lessons for their students so that they live and study in a harmony with music. I have an impression that students, who spend a great deal of their time studying different academic subjects should have an opportunity to cope with the stress gained during school time. In this case, music can be a useful and interesting solution. Moreover, if musical activity involves many participants, there will be co-operation and developed team work in the group, which is, of course, beneficial in their future life. In fact, students with a quite poor academic background can show themselves in the music. Consequently, the calm atmosphere in the class might be created.
 By contrast, it is clear that music can have many mentally enhancing effects on students. In our hectic life, however, demand is not for musically orientated students, but for academically developed employees. Hence, I agree with the majority, because music is the art which requires special attitude towards it. Increasingly however, students can not obtain supposed impacts, unless they get interested in it more seriously. Therefore, music and other entertaining subjects should be optional. Nowadays, time is the most valuable thing in life with increased pace. To my mind, students are to develop their professional skills by learning occupation-related subjects, rather than playing on guitar or singing a song.
 In conclusion, I think that in order to be a competitive worker, students must know their field in an advanced level. On the other hand, music can help an individual to shape its character. An integration of music into learning process bound to be successful when it is not compulsory.
";"Music has been an integral part of human life since the dawn of civilization. It has been used to express emotions, tell stories, and even to heal. In recent years, music has become increasingly popular in schools, with many high schools offering music classes as part of their curriculum. But should high school make music lessons compulsory?
 
 The answer to this question is a resounding yes. Music has been proven to have a positive effect on students academic performance, as well as their overall well-being. Studies have shown that students who take music classes tend to have higher grades and better test scores than those who do not. Music also helps to reduce stress and anxiety, and can even improve memory and concentration. Furthermore, music can help to foster creativity and critical thinking skills, which are essential for success in any field.
 
 In addition to the academic benefits, music can also help to foster a sense of community among students. Music classes provide a safe and supportive environment for students to express themselves and explore their creativity. This can help to create a sense of belonging and connection between students, which can be beneficial for their social and emotional development.
 
 Finally, music can be a great way for students to explore their interests and develop their talents. Music classes can provide students with the opportunity to explore different genres of music, as well as learn how to play instruments. This can help to develop their skills and open up new career paths.
 
 In conclusion, high school should make music lessons compulsory. Music has been proven to have a positive effect on students academic performance, as well as their overall well-being. It can also help to foster a sense of community and provide students with the opportunity to explore their interests and develop their talents. Therefore, making music lessons compulsory in high school is a great way to ensure that students get the most out of their education.";"Music has always been a part of human life. From the ancient times when people used to sing and dance around the campfire to modern times when people can listen to any type of music they want, music has always been a constant in our lives. Therefore, many believe that it should be made compulsory in high school.
 
 Music is not only a form of entertainment or a way of expressing oneself but it also teaches discipline, patience, practice and responsibility. Learning music requires hours of practice, dedication, and hard work. It teaches perseverance and develops the students concentration skills. Practicing a musical instrument helps students to develop a sense of self-discipline and encourages students to practice self-motivation. As a result, students can become better organized, focused and set goals in other aspects of their life.
 
 Moreover, students who learn music increase their focus, improve academic performance and gain confidence. Some studies have shown that learning an instrument improves academic performance as it helps to increase concentration and discipline in other subjects. Learning music also stimulates creativity and self-expression. Playing music can be a great outlet for children and teenagers to express themselves and explore their emotions. Research has shown that music can enhance the learning process in many ways. It can help students to understand abstract ideas and retain information better. Thus, learning music can enhance a students academic performance both inside and outside the music classroom.
 
 In conclusion, music lessons should be made compulsory in high school as they have both educational and emotional benefits. Music helps to foster discipline, creativity, self-expression, and increases academic performance. Music lessons can also be a great outlet for children and teenagers to explore their emotions and as such should be made compulsory in high school.";48;2048;2010;1927;1968.5
50;50;essay51.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/essay-pros-cons-developments-agriculture-23379/;pros and cons of developments in agriculture;"A matter of considerable controversy at present is the issue of whether developments in agriculture are beneficial to humankind, or rather these developments should be allowed to die out just as many inappropriate innovations have in the past. From my perspective, these developments in agricultures should be preserved for the sake of the benefits of all human beings.
 To begin with, innovations in agriculture such as mechanized farming and the creations of genetic engineering foods may be the only way to feed the vast number of people in every corner of the world. Imagine the tragedies that would ensue if people lived in famine and started to eat people to survive. Therefore, governments around the world have the obligation to fund in technological developments in farming in order to make an enough production of food for its people. Another reason for applied technology in agriculture is the low-priced foods resulted from the widely used of factory farming. Thanks to the lower expenditure in food consuming, low income people now have sufficient money to cover up costs in health and education.
 Nonetheless, opponents of modern technology in agriculture would argue that the proliferation of GE food and factory farming are detrimental to people's health. They further suggest that food which is genetically modified interrupts the natural balance of the ecosystem and would return to haunt us in unexpected ways. In other words, although technological developments in agriculture is beneficial in the short term, its long term negatives are significant.
 In reality, of course, the wide spread use of modern technology in agriculture may be problematic in itself; however, given the seriousness of food insufficiency through out the world, I believe this would be the ultimate goal.
";"Agriculture has been a cornerstone of human civilization since the dawn of time. It has been the basis of our food supply and has allowed us to develop and sustain our societies. In recent years, developments in agriculture have been made to increase efficiency, reduce costs, and improve the quality of our food. While these developments have been beneficial in many ways, there are also some potential drawbacks that should be considered.
 
 One of the major pros of developments in agriculture is the increased efficiency of production. Advances in technology have allowed farmers to produce more food with less labor and resources. This has resulted in lower costs for consumers and has allowed farmers to increase their profits. In addition, new technologies have allowed farmers to produce higher quality food with fewer pesticides and other chemicals. This has resulted in healthier food for consumers and a more sustainable agricultural system.
 
 On the other hand, there are some potential cons to developments in agriculture. One of the biggest concerns is the potential for increased environmental damage. Many of the new technologies used in agriculture require large amounts of energy and water, which can lead to pollution and other environmental problems. In addition, the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) has raised concerns about their potential impacts on human health and the environment. Finally, the increased efficiency of production has led to a decrease in the number of small-scale farmers, which has had a negative impact on rural communities.
 
 Overall, developments in agriculture have had both positive and negative impacts. While they have allowed us to produce more food with fewer resources, they have also raised some concerns about their potential impacts on the environment and human health. It is important to consider both the pros and cons of these developments when making decisions about our agricultural system.";"Agriculture is a crucial part of society, and one that has experienced many developments over the years. From the emergence of new technologies to advances in fertilizers, the industry has changed drastically in recent history. As with any change, there are both positives and negatives associated with developments in agriculture. In this essay, we will explore the pros and cons of advancements in this field.
 
 The primary advantage of developments in agriculture is that they have made farming simpler and more efficient. The use of modern equipment and technologies such as GPS tracking and robotics has made farming much easier and allows farmers to produce greater yields with less manual labor. This has resulted in increased production and lower costs for consumers. Additionally, advances in fertilizers and pesticides have made it possible for farmers to increase crop yields and keep pests under control.
 
 On the other hand, there are some drawbacks to developments in agriculture. For one, the heavy use of fertilizers and pesticides can have a negative effect on the environment, polluting rivers and causing soil degradation. Additionally, some of the new technologies have led to increased food insecurity in certain parts of the world. For example, the emergence of genetically modified crops has made it difficult for small farmers to compete and has resulted in a decrease in biodiversity.
 
 Overall, advancements in agriculture have had both positive and negative effects. While they have made farming simpler and more efficient, they have also caused environmental issues and have led to food insecurity in some areas. By weighing both the pros and cons of developments in agriculture, governments and policymakers can continue to make informed decisions about how to best balance the needs of citizens and the environment.";44;1800;1966;1848;1907.0
51;51;essay52.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/the-advantages-disadvantages-prevalent-english-23262/;advantages and disadvantages of the prevalent of English;"With the development of globalization, English became the dominated language in national trade, conference and many important events. This phenomenon has aroused a heated discussion in public.
 Some people claim that the prevalent of English brings a great number of benefits for people. First of all, it promotes the communication and interaction between different countries more conveniently and clearly. In the ancient time, the different languages and geography set barriers for people to exchange their goods and ideas. Fortunately, the innovation of plane and train solved the geographical barriers. If we can popularize the use of English, the language hinder will disappear as well. In addition, English is a beautiful language, which is more systematical and extensive than many other languages. Learning English can foster people's sentiment and nourish their literature and art.
 However, the opponents believe that the dominated status of English has destroyed culture diversity and many less-used languages become extinct. Even English is a sophisticated language; it does not express every detail of life especially in Asia countries, which have totally different linguistic system. It is undeniable that language contains many aspects of people's daily life, which is influenced by culture, environment as well as religious. Obviously, these languages have special significance for people who belong to them and using English to replace them is crudity.
 Personally, English as an elegant language should be advocated in many fields to expand the global trade and communications. But, we still need preserve other languages for sake of keeping the linguistic and cultural diversity.
";"English is a language that is spoken by people all over the world. It is the official language of many countries, and it is the language of international communication. With the prevalence of English, there are both advantages and disadvantages.
 
 One of the main advantages of the prevalence of English is that it allows people from different countries to communicate with each other. English is the language of business, and it is the language of international trade. This means that people from different countries can communicate with each other in order to do business. This can help to increase economic growth and development.
 
 Another advantage of the prevalence of English is that it allows people to access a wide range of information. English is the language of the internet, and it is the language of many books and other sources of information. This means that people can access a wide range of information in English, which can be beneficial for learning and development.
 
 However, there are also some disadvantages to the prevalence of English. One of the main disadvantages is that it can lead to the loss of local languages and cultures. As English becomes more prevalent, local languages and cultures can be lost as people switch to using English. This can lead to the loss of important cultural heritage and knowledge.
 
 Another disadvantage of the prevalence of English is that it can lead to inequality. English is the language of power and privilege, and those who do not speak English may be at a disadvantage in terms of access to education and employment opportunities. This can lead to inequality between those who speak English and those who do not.
 
 In conclusion, the prevalence of English has both advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, it allows people from different countries to communicate with each other and access a wide range of information. On the other hand, it can lead to the loss of local languages and cultures, and it can lead to inequality.";"English is the most widely spoken language in the world, and it has become an official language in more countries than any other language. With global communication becoming ever more important, the prevalence of the English language has become increasingly prominent. There are both advantages and disadvantages to the widespread use of English, and it is important to examine both sides of the issue in order to understand the full implications of this languages popularity.
 
 One of the main advantages of the prevalence of English is that it has become a universal language. Standardizing on one language makes it easier for people from different countries and backgrounds to communicate with each other. This has been beneficial in areas such as international business and diplomacy, where people of various backgrounds must work together and have a common means of communication. English has also made it easier for people to access information from around the globe. This can be especially helpful for those living in non-English speaking countries who wish to gain knowledge of topics or events happening elsewhere.
 
 However, there are also some drawbacks to the ubiquity of English. The prevalence of English has led to a lack of diversity in language. With English becoming dominant in so many countries, local languages can be neglected or forgotten. This can lead to a loss of cultural identity in many regions, and has put some minority languages at risk of becoming extinct. Additionally, the reliance on English has contributed to linguistic inequality in many parts of the world. Those who are not fluent in English may be at a disadvantage in terms of opportunities, as English is often a requirement for higher education or better job prospects.
 
 In conclusion, the prevalence of English has many advantages and disadvantages. While it has helped to reduce barriers to communication on an international level, the ubiquity of English has also created linguistic inequality and threatened the existence of many minority languages. It is important to understand both the advantages and disadvantages of the prevalence of English to be able to assess its overall impact on the global community.";56;1698;2002;2214;2108.0
52;52;essay53.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/humans-should-able-use-animals-own-benefit-27603/;humans should be able to use animals for their own benefit?;"Man has dominated all his fellow beings on earth because of his superior brain. He has domesticated a large number of animals and birds and makes use of them to make life easier and convenient for himself. Many people encourage the use of animals for their personal needs, while others are concerned that animals should not be misused. This essay will discuss some arguments for and against animal domestication.
 Human being has driven many animals for their personal use such as, cows and other milch animals for yielding milk from them. Likewise, other animals such as, horses, cattles and donkeys for farming, agriculture and as a mode of transportation. Many people keep pets like dogs and cats, trained them as service dogs and snuffing dogs which are very helpful to police force and even to some blind peoples. They are kept for security purposes in houses.
 On the other hand, many farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their limits. For instance, cows are often injected by Oxytocin, a hormone which is used to forcibly increase lactation. This in turn, causes lots of discomfort and pain to the cattle. Furthermore, thousand of animals undergo painful suffering or death as a result of scientific research of drugs and various products. Another example of this is cage farming which is against animal rights. Many other practices like, equestrian sport where horses run miles and miles and beaten up by jockeys to make them run more faster. And above all pleasure hunting of defenseless animals.
 From my prospective, human being should behave as a guardian to animals rather than as their lord or masters. Animal rights are meant to set limits on human behavior and manipulation of them should be punished as a serious crime.
";"Humans have been using animals for their own benefit since the dawn of time. From hunting for food to using them for transportation and labor, animals have been a part of human life for centuries. In recent years, however, the use of animals for human benefit has come under scrutiny. Animal rights activists argue that animals should not be used for human benefit, as it is cruel and unethical.
 
 While it is true that animals should not be subjected to cruel and inhumane treatment, it is also true that humans should be able to use animals for their own benefit. Animals can provide humans with food, clothing, transportation, and labor. In addition, animals can be used for medical research, which can lead to the development of treatments and cures for diseases.
 
 The use of animals for human benefit should be done in a humane and ethical manner. Animals should not be subjected to cruel and inhumane treatment, and their welfare should be taken into consideration. Animals should be provided with adequate food, water, shelter, and medical care. In addition, animals should not be used for activities that are dangerous or harmful to them.
 
 The use of animals for human benefit can also be beneficial to the environment. Animals can be used to help restore habitats, control pests, and provide food for other species. In addition, animals can be used to help maintain biodiversity, which is essential for a healthy environment.
 
 In conclusion, humans should be able to use animals for their own benefit, as long as it is done in a humane and ethical manner. Animals can provide humans with food, clothing, transportation, and labor, as well as help restore habitats and maintain biodiversity. However, animals should not be subjected to cruel and inhumane treatment, and their welfare should be taken into consideration.";"The debate over whether humans should be able to use animals for their own benefit is a highly charged one. There are those who argue that humans have a moral duty to respect and protect animals, while others contend that mankind has a right to make use of animals for their own benefit.
 
 Proponents of the use of animals contend that humans are stewards of the environment, and as such, have a responsibility to manage the natural world for their own benefit. Proponents note that animals have been used for centuries by humans for a variety of purposes, such as for food, clothing, and medical research. Proponents further maintain that the use of animals for research is a crucial tool that helps us advance medical science and save countless human lives.
 
 Opponents of the use of animals criticize this argument, contending that the use of animals is morally wrong. Opponents argue that humans have a duty of care to animals and should not sacrifice them for their own benefit. Opponents contend that while the use of animals in research may yield beneficial results, it can also inflict pain and suffering on animals, and as such, should not be allowed.
 
 In my opinion, humans should be able to use animals for their own benefit, provided that the welfare of the animals is always taken into consideration. Animals should never be subjected to pain or suffering for any purpose. Moreover, we should use animals only when there is no viable alternative available, such as when medical research requires the use of animal subjects. When we do use animals, we should ensure that their welfare is always taken into consideration.
 
 To conclude, I believe that humans should be able to use animals for their own benefit, as long as their welfare is taken into consideration. Animals should not be subjected to unnecessary pain or suffering, and the use of animals should only be done when there is no alternative. With this in mind, I believe the use of animals can be justified.";59;1742;1834;1986;1910.0
53;53;essay54.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/museums-art-galleries-disappear-soon-27515/;museums and art galleries will disappear soon?;"It is quite common that more and more people can watch exhibitions through television or internet at home due to modern technology; therefore, some people think museums and art galleries will disappear soon. Although modern technology make it possible, I still believe some museums and art galleries will not disappear.
 On the one hand, technology indeed simplifies people's life all the time. Obviously, people who watch exhibitions on TV or internet at home, save the time and money on the road, which is increasingly significant particularly to people in modern society. However, in accordance with recent research, experts suggest the lifestyle of individuals in modern society is unhealthy because they lack of physical exercise and face-to-face communication.
 On the other hand, the importance of museums and art galleries is plain in terms of education and culture. First of all, authentic exhibits cannot be completely displayed only by images and videos. It is like travelling to a place is much better than viewing the landscape of that place on TV or photos, so the best method to learn one thing is to experience it. Furthermore, museums and art galleries preserve some culture heritages; therefore, these buildings will not disappear unless people abandon their culture.
 In conclusion, I admit that modern technology has provided a more convenient and comfortable manner for people to watch exhibitions, but museums and art galleries are necessary to be preserved for its importance of education and culture.
";"Museums and art galleries have been a part of our culture for centuries, providing us with a window into the past and a way to appreciate the beauty of art. However, with the rise of digital technology, it is becoming increasingly likely that these institutions will soon disappear.
 
 The first reason why museums and art galleries are at risk of disappearing is the rise of digital technology. With the advent of digital photography, it is now possible to take high-quality photographs of artwork and display them online. This has made it easier for people to access artwork without having to visit a museum or art gallery. Furthermore, digital technology has made it possible for people to create virtual exhibitions, allowing them to experience artwork from the comfort of their own home. As a result, museums and art galleries are no longer the only way to experience art.
 
 The second reason why museums and art galleries are at risk of disappearing is the cost associated with running them. Museums and art galleries require a lot of money to maintain, and with the current economic climate, it is becoming increasingly difficult for them to stay afloat. Furthermore, many museums and art galleries are funded by government grants, which are becoming increasingly scarce. As a result, many museums and art galleries are being forced to close their doors due to lack of funding.
 
 The third reason why museums and art galleries are at risk of disappearing is the changing tastes of the public. As people become more exposed to digital technology, they are becoming less interested in traditional forms of art. Furthermore, with the rise of modern art, many people are no longer interested in visiting museums and art galleries to view artwork. As a result, museums and art galleries are losing their appeal to the public.
 
 In conclusion, it is becoming increasingly likely that museums and art galleries will soon disappear. This is due to the rise of digital technology, the cost associated with running them, and the changing tastes of the public. While this is a sad prospect, it is important to remember that the artwork in these institutions will still be available to us through digital technology.";"Museums and art galleries have long been viewed as sources of knowledge and culture, offering valuable insight into the past and opportunities to explore the works of renowned artists. While these institutions have stood the test of time, a growing number of commentators are stating that these establishments may soon become a thing of the past. 
 
 Many of these assertions come from the fact that in recent years, traditional forms of museum and gallery operations have become outdated. As digital technology continues to improve, more people are turning to their electronic devices to consume art. For example, art blogs, digital archives, and streaming platforms are quickly becoming preferred to physical spaces. Furthermore, the rise of virtual reality and digital art is further diminishing the importance of physical museums and galleries. 
 
 The global pandemic has also had a negative effect on the continued success of traditional museums and galleries. With social distancing in place and more people opting to stay indoors, physical locations have seen a drastic decrease in visitors. Furthermore, due to the significant financial losses, there are now fears that museums and galleries will have to close down indefinitely due to their inability to generate sufficient revenue. 
 
 In addition, the future of physical art institutions is challenged by the fact that these establishments are expensive to maintain. The cost of staffing, electricity, and security are a burden that many museums and galleries may no longer be able to bear as expenses continue to rise. 
 
 Overall, it appears that the days of traditional museums and art galleries may soon be coming to an end. With the rise of digital technology, decreased visitors due to the pandemic, and the ever-growing cost of operations, it is becoming increasingly difficult for physical institutions to stay financially afloat. As a result, it may soon be the case that digital art and virtual reality become the new source of artistic engagement.";46;1525;2214;2020;2117.0
54;54;essay55.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/should-teenagers-learn-all-school-subjects-focus-one-subject-27187/;should teenagers learn all school subjects/focus on one subject;"Presently, it is commonly accepted that students have to learn over eight subjects in school. Public retain differing views on whether to teach students all subjects or just focus on one subject. Some parents are satisfied with the full class schedule of their children. While, others claim that studying only one subject is more effective. Before rendering my own opinion, I will explore sides of this topic.
 The benefits of teaching students different units are easily recognized. In the first place, with some basic knowledge of diverse fields, students have more options in choosing specialized areas or jobs in the future. Teenagers are still too young and immature to decide what they are going to dedicate. In students' point of view, the combination of difficult and easy subjects balances their schoolwork stress and fosters their enthusiasm on classes. However, still many teenagers cannot enjoy the variation of the curriculum, instead, they feel more stressful with so much homework and exams to be done. Besides, most students regard the extra knowledge useless and impractical for their future jobs.
 Those who advocate focusing on one subject believe that this education model can cultivate more talents who specialized in different areas and increase studying effectiveness. This is probably because students can devote more time and efforts in one subject and reduce pressure from other subjects. However, the drawbacks of this teaching method cannot be neglected. Most importantly, under such target-oriented education environment, teenagers may be hard to regret their original choice and change their specialized field in their further study. Moreover, the dullness of course may deeply influence their passion on study.
 It is undeniable that concentrating on one subject can reduce students' pressure and foster the effectiveness in training talents, while its shortfalls are so vital to students' future. Therefore, I do support the view of learning all school subjects.
";"The debate over whether teenagers should learn all school subjects or focus on one subject has been ongoing for many years. On one hand, some people argue that teenagers should learn all school subjects in order to develop a well-rounded education. On the other hand, others argue that teenagers should focus on one subject in order to become experts in that particular area. Ultimately, the decision of whether teenagers should learn all school subjects or focus on one subject should be based on the individual needs and interests of the student.
 
 Those who argue that teenagers should learn all school subjects believe that this approach will provide a more comprehensive education. By learning all school subjects, teenagers will be exposed to a variety of topics and gain a better understanding of the world around them. Additionally, this approach will help teenagers develop a range of skills, such as critical thinking, problem solving, and communication. Furthermore, learning all school subjects will give teenagers the opportunity to explore their interests and discover new passions.
 
 On the other hand, those who argue that teenagers should focus on one subject believe that this approach will help teenagers become experts in that particular area. By focusing on one subject, teenagers will be able to gain a deeper understanding of the material and develop a greater level of proficiency. Additionally, this approach will help teenagers develop the skills and knowledge necessary to pursue a career in that particular field. Furthermore, focusing on one subject will allow teenagers to develop a sense of mastery and confidence in their abilities.
 
 Ultimately, the decision of whether teenagers should learn all school subjects or focus on one subject should be based on the individual needs and interests of the student. For some teenagers, learning all school subjects may be the best approach, while for others, focusing on one subject may be more beneficial. It is important for teenagers to explore their interests and determine which approach is best for them. With the right guidance and support, teenagers can make an informed decision that will help them reach their academic and career goals.";"The question of whether teenagers should learn all school subjects or focus on one subject is a complex one. On the one hand, learning a variety of subjects can be beneficial. It can give teenagers a better understanding of the world, as well as a greater appreciation for different cultures and views. This can be especially important for teens who are trying to discover their place in the world. Additionally, learning many subjects can help to create a well-rounded individual, who is equipped to tackle a variety of academic, professional, and personal goals.
 
 On the other hand, focusing on a single subject can also be advantageous. It can allow teens to develop a deep understanding of a particular field, and can give them the foundation necessary to pursue higher levels of education or specialization in a subject. Developing expertise in one subject can also be a very rewarding experience, as it can give teens a sense of accomplishment in an otherwise challenging academic environment.
 
 In conclusion, it can be beneficial for teenagers to learn a variety of school subjects, as well as focus on one subject and develop a deep understanding of it. This can help teens to have a broad-based education while still giving them the ability to pursue specialized knowledge in a particular area. Ultimately, it may be best for teenagers to strike a balance between learning many subjects and focusing deeper on one, so that they can gain the most benefit from their education.";63;1995;2223;1488;1855.5

Some people claim it's a reasonable loss in globalization while others argue the demerits exceed the merits. Personally, I agree with the former opinion.
 No one can deny the huge benefits of the trend that English is being accepted universally. To begin with, communication between countries and cultures become convenient. In my country, English is a required course from elementary school. Thus, studying abroad is easy and becomes hot among youngsters. For them, language obstacle is no longer a problem, which results in mutual understanding and trust between their mother land and the host country. This, in turn, enhances relationship and promotes international business. Furthermore, researchers, especially those who work on high-tech, would have wider range of references if they are good at English. Taking IT industry for an example, top technical science is published in English. It's neither to get a translated version of these articles, nor to always have a translator besides. As a result, they have no choice but choosing English as a second language.
 Admittedly, opponents may blame that English is making lesser-known languages disappear ever year. Hence, the culture heritage and nation identity vanish. However, this is really short-sighted, ignoring the rapid development of native economy and society.
 In conclusion, in spite of some negative effects, I'm totally convinced that the prevalent usage of English brings benefits to people and countries all around. I suggest all youths should learn English owing to its key role in globalization. But at the same time, actions, like recording, can be taken to protect native languages and cultures.
";"The English language has been a powerful force in the world for centuries. It has been used to communicate, to spread knowledge, and to create a global community. English has been the language of choice for many countries, and its influence has been felt in almost every corner of the world.
 
 The advantages of English are numerous. It is the most widely spoken language in the world, and it is the official language of many countries. English is also the language of international business, and it is the language of the internet. English is the language of science, and it is the language of literature. English is also the language of diplomacy, and it is the language of education.
 
 English has also been a great tool for cultural exchange. It has allowed people from different countries to communicate and understand each other. English has allowed people to share ideas, to learn from each other, and to create a global community.
 
 Despite its many advantages, English has also had some disadvantages. It has been used to spread colonialism and imperialism, and it has been used to oppress minority languages. English has also been used to create a divide between different cultures and countries.
 
 However, the advantages of English far outweigh the disadvantages. English has been a powerful force for good in the world, and it has allowed people to communicate, to share knowledge, and to create a global community. English has been a powerful tool for cultural exchange, and it has allowed people to learn from each other and to create a more unified world.
 
 In conclusion, the influence of English has been immense, and its advantages far outweigh its disadvantages. English has been a powerful force for good in the world, and it has allowed people to communicate, to share knowledge, and to create a global community. English has been a powerful tool for cultural exchange, and it has allowed people to learn from each other and to create a more unified world.";"When it comes to the influence of English, there is no denying that its impact has penetrated various countries globally including those in the Eastern and Western hemispheres. English has become not only a language for international communication but also a language for commerce, science, and education. It is considered to be the language of the world, and with good reason. Its influence is undeniable and there are numerous advantages and disadvantages that have come with it.
 
 The English language has had a tremendous influence on many different countries through its use as a global language. This has allowed people from different backgrounds to communicate easily and understand each other. It means that English as a language has bridged the gap between cultures and provided a platform for global conversations with a single language to unite people from different backgrounds.
 
 Another advantage to Englishs influence is that it has opened up new opportunities for countries and individuals around the world. The English language is the official language for international communication and the lingua franca for business and economic developments. As the language is increasingly spoken, the opportunities for people to engage in international conversations, business, and academic exchanges increase. Furthermore, since English is the language of technology and art, it has also been instrumental in facilitating the spread of knowledge and understanding about the world.
 
 However, the influence of English has not been without its detractors. Critics argue that English has been used as a tool to dominate and subjugate countries and cultures that do not speak it. They argue that English has been used to undermine other languages and cultures, as well as create barriers to communication between people of different backgrounds.
 
 In conclusion, while there may be some disadvantages to the influence of English, its advantages far outweigh the disadvantages. English has served to bridge the gap between different cultures and provided a platform for global conversations. It has opened up new opportunities for countries and individuals, and facilitated the spread of knowledge and understanding. Therefore, while it is important to be aware of the potential disadvantages of relying so heavily on the English language, it is clear that the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages.";60;1818;1983;2410;2196.5
56;56;essay57.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/creativity-should-given-freedom-restrictions-26868/;creativity-should it be given freedom or restrictions;"Creativity is the ability to think beyond the obvious. Many governments restrict the artistic works of the creative minds. Creativity originates in a free mind. Hence, creative artists must be given the freedom to express their ideas without any restrictions.
 Time and again, creative artists like Michaelangelo, Picasso, Salman Rushdie, Shakespeare etc. have made artistic works which gave a social message. Right from sculptures to paintings, books to drama and movies, all these artistic works have reflected the contemporary social issues of different eras. Creative works help to create social awareness by giving a social message.
 Nonetheless, innovative works makes people realise things in a peaceful way and peep into their own conscience. It helps to raise issues and criticise the wrong doings of the governments. For instance, Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin was accused of acting against the government, just because she raised a social issue. This type of approach is a hurdle in promoting creative minds. In addition, creativity also gives aesthetic charm.
 Unfortunately, many governments restrict the artists. Frank Zappa once said, "" Mind is like a parachute, it doesn't work if its not open."" Restrictions would just curb the innovative ideas of the artists and would limit their brains. Like the media, artists should also be given the freedom to express their ideas freely.
 However, artists should also know not to hurt the sentiments of the people. Many artists have been involved in controversies because of hurting the religious or social beliefs of the common people. Artists should have self-awareness not to create vulgar, hurtful or useless works which do not serve any purpose. I firmly believe that artists should be given the freedom of expression. Mind can not work when it is chained in boundaries. Imagination is at its best when the mind is relaxed and free from the fear of government or any restrictive laws.
";"Creativity is a powerful tool that can be used to create beautiful works of art, innovate new products, and solve complex problems. It is an essential part of the human experience, and it should be given the freedom to express itself. However, there are times when restrictions should be placed on creativity in order to ensure that it is used responsibly and ethically.
 
 Creativity should be given freedom to express itself because it is a natural part of the human experience. It allows us to explore new ideas, find solutions to problems, and create works of art that can inspire and move us. Without creativity, our lives would be much duller and less meaningful. We should be free to explore our creative ideas without fear of judgement or criticism.
 
 At the same time, there are times when restrictions should be placed on creativity. For example, if a creative work is offensive or harmful to others, it should not be allowed to be published or displayed. Additionally, if a creative work is plagiarized or stolen, it should not be allowed to be used or sold. These restrictions are necessary to ensure that creativity is used responsibly and ethically.
 
 In conclusion, creativity should be given freedom to express itself, but there are times when restrictions should be placed on it. These restrictions are necessary to ensure that creativity is used responsibly and ethically. By allowing creativity to express itself freely, we can create beautiful works of art, innovate new products, and solve complex problems.";"Creativity is a valuable tool that has been used in various areas of human endeavors and societies throughout history. It is a unique form of expression, an outlet for ideas, beliefs and emotions. While creativity is an invaluable tool, it is important to consider whether or not it should be given freedom or restrictions.
 
 Creativity should be given freedom to some degree. This is because it is a highly personal cornerstone of our lives and it allows us to be open and creative, thereby increasing our exploratory skills. In addition, freedom of creativity allows us to have expressive outlets, which can be calming and therapeutic. This can be especially beneficial for those suffering from depression, anxiety, or other mental health issues. Additionally, creativity has a range of potential benefits for us, such as improving our problem solving skills and helping us to think in more creative ways.
 
 At the same time, it is important to note that creativity should not be given absolute freedom. Too much freedom of creativity can lead to irresponsible or dangerous outcomes. For example, a lack of restrictions on creativity could result in the creation of content, ideas, or art that is offensive or inappropriate. Furthermore, there should be limits on the use of creativity that are in the publics best interests. For example, restrictions should be put in place to ensure that creativity cannot be used to create hate speech or materials that incite violence or hatred.
 
 In conclusion, creativity should be given freedom, but it should also be regulated so that it is not used to create inappropriate or potentially dangerous content. This can help to ensure that creativity is used for the purposes that are in the publics best interests, and can help to foster creativity in a safe and responsible manner.";53;1951;1530;1826;1678.0
57;57;essay58.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/competition-co-operation-better-26822/;competition or co-operation-which is better;"The modern society is full of cut-throat competition. Some people think that inculcating co-operative approach in a child is essential while some think that competing is the best way to succeed. However, co-operative approach always helps a child to become a responsible adult with good moral values and a friendly social circle.
 Co-operation is essential for teamwork. Educational systems emphasize on encouraging co-operative approach in children. We live in a social setup and mutual help and sharing only leads to success. A person can not learn or achieve everything by oneself. For instance, lions hunt in a team. It is only due to their teamwork that they are able to catch a prey and make task easy. In the same way, co-operative approach will save time, energy and will have a higher success rate.
 Nevertheless, co-operation helps to understand other's perspective and learn by their mistakes. It helps to identify one's strengths and weaknesses as compared to others. A co-operative approach can create inspirational and motivational feeling seeing other people's achievements. However, competition is also as important as co-operation.
 Unfortunately, the meaning of competion has been modified in a wrong direction. An individual must compete with oneself only, instead of trying to beat others. Competition has helped the development of science and technology. Competition helps in improvement and evolution. For example, every other day, new cars are developed by companies which are more efficient than others. This kind of competition gives customers more options.
 However, blind and selfish competition is detrimental. 'Your loss, my gain' kind of competition can never be fruitful in the long run. Competition should be always based on self-improvement rule. A healthy competition which involves raising one's own level above others is the best approach.
 Thus, competition and co-operation go hand in hand. These are two sides of the same coin which can't be seperated. I firmly believe that children should be taught co-operation complimented with a healthy competition. They must be made aware of the demerits of selfish competition. When co-operation and healthy competition is followed together, success, achievements, recognition and any goal becomes easier.
 
";"Competition or cooperation: which is better? This is a question that has been debated for centuries. While both approaches have their merits, it is clear that cooperation is the better approach for achieving success in the long run.
 
 Competition is often seen as a way to motivate people to work harder and achieve more. It can be a powerful tool for pushing people to reach their goals. However, it can also lead to unhealthy competition and a lack of collaboration. When people are in competition with each other, they are more likely to focus on their own interests and less likely to work together. This can lead to a lack of trust and cooperation, which can be damaging to any team or organization.
 
 Cooperation, on the other hand, is a much more effective way to achieve success. When people work together, they are more likely to trust each other and share ideas. This leads to better communication and collaboration, which can lead to better results. Cooperation also encourages people to think outside the box and come up with creative solutions to problems. This can lead to more innovative and successful outcomes.
 
 In conclusion, while competition can be a useful tool for motivating people, it is clear that cooperation is the better approach for achieving success in the long run. Cooperation encourages people to work together, trust each other, and come up with creative solutions. This leads to better communication, collaboration, and ultimately better results.";"The human race has been relying on competition and cooperation since the dawn of time. Competition has been seen in numerous aspects of our lives and has been the driving force behind many groundbreaking accomplishments. Cooperation, on the other hand, has been the key to success in many team sports and business settings. While both competition and cooperation have their merits, it is essential to determine which one is more beneficial for society in the long run.
 
 Competition is often viewed as the more powerful of the two. It is the engine that drives innovators and entrepreneurs to push the boundaries of technology and business. The competitive spirit is also seen in competitive sports and other activities that encourages individual growth and development. By competing against one another, individuals strive to be the best they can be and challenge themselves to be better than they were before. In a world that is constantly changing and advancing, competition can be necessary in order to stay ahead of the curve and remain competitive.
 
 However, while competition has its benefits, it can also lead to negative outcomes. Competition tends to foster a sense of rivalry between individuals and often generates negative feelings and emotions. In addition, competition can be a cause of unhealthy pressure and stress for some people who feel pressured to be the best.
 
 On the other hand, cooperation can be beneficial in many aspects of life. Cooperation is essential in team sports, working in groups, and in business settings. It helps create a sense of unity and camaraderie among members of a group and encourages them to work together in order to achieve a common goal. Unlike competition, cooperation does not foster a sense of rivalry or insecurity among people. Instead, it encourages positive collaboration, encourages individuals to share their thoughts and ideas, and creates an environment that is conducive to learning and growth.
 
 Overall, it is clear that both competition and cooperation have their benefits and drawbacks. Ultimately, it is up to individuals to decide which one is more beneficial. In most cases, the best approach is to use a combination of both. While competition may be necessary to drive innovation and progress in certain areas, cooperation can also be beneficial in terms of team building and working together. In the end, it is important to remember that no matter the situation, both competition and cooperation can play a key role in achieving success.";43;2288;1485;2516;2000.5
58;58;essay59.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/capital-punishment-necessary-not-26702/;capital punishment..necessary or not;"Crime is always punishable. Retribution is the method for countering criminals. Some countries have stringent rules, like capital punishment, while other have a lot of flexibility in the judicial system. However, strict laws, like capital punishment, are essential in a society.
 Capital punishment is given only in the "" rarest of the rare"" cases. Its first and foremost objective is safety of other human beings. When a criminal becomes a threat to the society, such that they can commit heinous crimes, then they are given capital punishment. Thus, capital punishment protects the society from hardcore criminals.
 Moreover, capital punishment curbs the inspiration and prospects of other hateful crimes. When a criminal mind knows the quantum of punishment, they will fear and not commit such crimes. Thus, the rate of crime and violence is effectively decreased.
 Importantly, capital punishment saves a lot of government funding which is wasted in maintenance of these hardcore criminals. Criminals who don't have any chance of improvement or who have a past record of such crimes are, therefore, given capital punishment.
 However, the jury giving the verdict are also humans. They have the life of a person at their discretion. They can make mistakes which can sometimes affect an innocent, circumstantially marred criminals. The jury must therefore, take into account the circumstances of committing a crime. For example, if an individual murders someone for self-defence, then such a crime is not heinous. Only deserving criminals, who commit such hateful crimes in their proper senses are subjected to capital punishment.
 Capital punishment is essential to control violence in the society. I firmly believe that psychopaths, terrorists or any other criminal who lacks empathy for other human lives deserve capital punishment. Capital punishment helps to safeguard human rights in a strict and effective manner. However, it should be considered as the last option by the jury and all circumstances must be taken into account before pronouncing the final verdict.
";"Capital punishment, also known as the death penalty, is the most severe form of punishment for criminal offenses. It has been used as a form of justice for centuries, and is still used in many countries today. The debate over whether or not capital punishment is necessary has been ongoing for years, with both sides presenting compelling arguments.
 
 Proponents of capital punishment argue that it is a necessary tool for deterring crime and providing justice to victims and their families. They point to studies that show that the death penalty is an effective deterrent to crime, and that it can help to reduce the number of violent crimes committed. They also argue that it is a just punishment for those who have committed the most heinous of crimes, and that it can provide closure to victims and their families.
 
 On the other hand, opponents of capital punishment argue that it is an inhumane and ineffective form of punishment. They point to studies that show that the death penalty does not deter crime, and that it is often applied unfairly, with racial and economic disparities in sentencing. They also argue that it is a cruel and unusual punishment, and that it does not provide justice to victims and their families.
 
 Ultimately, the decision of whether or not capital punishment is necessary is a moral one. Those who support the death penalty believe that it is a necessary tool for deterring crime and providing justice to victims and their families. Those who oppose it believe that it is an inhumane and ineffective form of punishment. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide whether or not they believe capital punishment is necessary.";"Capital punishment, also known as the death penalty, is a controversial issue that has been at the forefront of the justice system in many countries around the world. This practice has been in use as a form of punishment as far back as recorded history. It is used as a deterrent against certain crimes, and its proponents argue that it serves as a form of retribution for victims, their families, and the general public. However, there is a great deal of debate surrounding the efficacy and morality of capital punishment.
 
 Supporters of capital punishment argue that it deters crime by serving as a powerful deterrent; if people know that they face a real risk of execution, they likely be less likely to commit murder or other capital offenses. Another argument in favor of capital punishment is that it serves as a form of retribution for victims, their families, and the general public. It is believed that the death penalty is a way of providing justice for those who have been victimized in a heinous way. Finally, proponents of the death penalty argue that it is just and necessary in general, asserting that if certain crimes are so severe that they are deserving of death, then it is morally and ethically justifiable to carry out execution.
 
 Opponents of capital punishment, however, have a host of reasons to oppose the death penalty. To begin, many question its efficacy as a deterrent. There is no concrete evidence to suggest that it actually prevents people from committing capital crimes. In addition, there is the moral argumentmany believe that execution is morally wrong and that human life is too precious to be taken away in such a way. Others question the fairness of capital punishment, as the system is inherently biased and often disproportionately affects racial minorities. Finally, there is the notion of wrongful conviction, as there is no way to undo the punishment of death if a person is later exonerated or found to be innocent.
 
 Ultimately, the debate over capital punishment is complex and highly charged with emotion. It has been a valid form of punishment for centuries and still carries a great deal of weight in todays criminal justice system; however, there are plenty of valid arguments against its use. It is important to consider the moral implications of such a policy and to evaluate the effectiveness of capital punishment in deterring crime and providing justice to victims.";36;2074;1670;2428;2049.0
59;59;essay60.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/is-break-good-bad-after-high-school-students-26657/;is a break good or bad after high school for students;"Studies are an essential part of life.Some countries permit students to take a break from studies between high school and university studies, while in some countries, it is considered as waste of time. However, a break of one year is good for young people after finishing their high school.
 In most education systems, a child studies continously from the age of 5 till 16 years of age. A relaxation of one year to young minds will give them a quintessential change. A continous study pressure for over 10 years makes the mind saturated and like a robot, to follow instructions. Personally, a break will give students some time to refresh their systems, by travelling or following their hobbies. Importantly, when students start their university studies after a break, they will feel fresh and full of energy to take the new challenge.
 Nevertheless, during high school, many students face a dilemma to decide which stream should they major in. Working or travelling for some time, after high school, can help them to find their field of interest. It will also help them to learn professional setup by working. Financially,students can save a little money to support their university education by doing a job. Some students even utilise this time for preparation of their desired university course.
 However, there are also disadvantages. A break can disturb the focus of students and prove detrimental. When students work during these breaks, the feel of money gives them an illusion that such salary is enough for them and they go in a utopia. For instance, my cousin started working in a customer care centre after high school and got distracted. When he started his university studies, he failed miserably. Students can also indulge in smoking or drinking during this time. But , the break should be an optional thing. It varies from individual to individual, how they utilise that period. A break gives students more benefits than harms.
 Importantly, the sole purpose of education is to nurture a young mind and not thrust studies on them. Thus, a break should be necessarily allowed to young minds between their high school and university studies. Countries, like India, where such a break is considered a blot, should understand that young minds are delicate and they face a cut-throat competition. One year break can help young people to prepare for the challenges of life.
";"A break after high school can be a beneficial or detrimental experience for students depending on how it is used. On one hand, a break can provide students with the opportunity to take a much-needed break from the rigors of high school and explore their interests and passions. This can be a great way to gain perspective and clarity on what they want to pursue in college and beyond. Additionally, a break can provide students with the opportunity to gain valuable work experience, travel, and volunteer, all of which can help them become more well-rounded individuals.
 
 On the other hand, a break can be detrimental to students if it is used as an excuse to procrastinate and avoid taking the necessary steps to prepare for college. If students use their break to simply relax and not take any steps to further their education, they may find themselves unprepared and behind when they enter college. Additionally, a break can be detrimental if students use it to engage in activities that could be harmful to their future, such as substance abuse or criminal activity.
 
 In conclusion, a break after high school can be beneficial or detrimental depending on how it is used. If students use their break to explore their interests, gain valuable work experience, and prepare for college, it can be a great way to gain perspective and clarity on their future. However, if students use their break to procrastinate and engage in activities that could be harmful to their future, it can be detrimental. Ultimately, it is up to the individual student to decide how to best use their break after high school.";"A break after high school is a beneficial pursuit for many students transitioning into adulthood. While a hiatus from formal education can provide a much-needed mental and physical break after completing the high school journey, there are many benefits for those who choose to continue their education. 
 
 Taking a break after high school can help recent graduates rest and re-energize from the demands of their academic career. Without the pressure of classes and exams, recent graduates can take the time to explore their interests and passions, which will be beneficial for their future. It provides an opportunity for young adults to cultivate important life skills such as time management, organization and financial planning. During this time, students can explore new hobbies, volunteer opportunities, internships and travel. Taking a break allows students to gain valuable experiences and exposure to the world around them before committing to a long-term educational pathway. 
 
 For students who choose to pursue higher education after high school, they can benefit from applying the skills they have acquired in their break to their studies. A break can provide students with applicable real-world experiences and expose them to potential career paths, which can help inform their college and career decisions. Taking a break can allow students to gain insight into the higher education system and discover hidden potential academic interests, which can inspire passion and motivation when students return to their studies. 
 
 For many students, taking a break after high school can be a great life-changing experience. It can provide them with valuable experiences and skills that will help them in their future, while allowing them to rest and recharge from their academic career. It is important for recent graduates to assess their motivations and interests before committing to a particular path, as there are benefits to both taking a break and continuing their education.";53;2383;1606;1991;1798.5

Ever since Charles Babbage (know as ""Father of computers"") invented computers, its development never had a pause. The whole world is dependent on computers, without which, the world will go back hundreds of years.
 In the modern world, computers are used everywhere. Right from flying planes to sending a small document, computers are needed. They are used in space programmes , wars, hospitals, schools and so on. Computers have made human life more easy, convenient and lightning fast. For example, in earlier days , if one had to send a message to someone in other country, it used to take months. But today, it can be sent in few minutes by typing a email and few clicks. Computers provide speed, increase efficiency, accuracy, precision, help to increase productivity and other countless benefits are provided by it.
 Moreover, future prospects of computers are very bright. From a computer as big as a room, it has now been minimized to the size of a palm. Nanotechnology is working to make computers to the order of microscopic levels. Research on making computerised drone soldiers (unmanned computer controlled) is going on. There is no end to the evolution of computers.
 However, everything has pros and cons. Computers have made humans over-dependent. Virus programs, privacy breach, leak of confidential documents, cyber attacks, identity theft, frauds etc. are some of its demerits, from a countless list. Computers expose children to vulgar materials. They have even invaded mental health of humans, for example , FAD (Facebook Addiction Disorder- excessive use of social networking website Facebook). Computers have intruded our lives to the effect that a satellite can peep into our homes and privates lives. The recent case of Wikileaks , leaking confidential data is an example of how computers are harmful.
 Nevertheless, with all the mentioned demerits, computers have provided security and sophistication too. Thus, dependence on computers is not a bad thing. However, one needs to be aware of all the pros and cons and beware of malicious things. Computer was invented for the benefit of mankind and it has fulfilled its objective. Human life today can't be imagined without computers, so not depending on them is out of question.
";"Computers have become an integral part of our lives. They have revolutionized the way we work, communicate, and entertain ourselves. From the early days of the personal computer to the current era of cloud computing, computers have made our lives easier and more efficient.
 
 The use of computers has grown exponentially over the years. They are used in almost every aspect of our lives, from the workplace to the home. In the workplace, computers are used to automate processes, store and analyze data, and facilitate communication. In the home, computers are used for entertainment, communication, and education. Computers have also become essential tools for businesses, allowing them to manage their operations more efficiently and effectively.
 
 The future of computers looks very promising. With the advancement of technology, computers are becoming increasingly powerful and capable of performing more complex tasks. In the near future, computers will be able to process large amounts of data quickly and accurately, allowing businesses to make better decisions and improve their operations. Additionally, computers will be able to interact with humans in more natural ways, allowing us to communicate and collaborate more effectively.
 
 However, there is a downside to the increasing use of computers. Over-dependence on computers can lead to a lack of critical thinking skills and a decrease in productivity. Additionally, computers can be vulnerable to cyber-attacks, which can lead to the loss of important data and information. Therefore, it is important to use computers responsibly and to ensure that they are properly secured.
 
 In conclusion, computers have become an essential part of our lives. They have revolutionized the way we work, communicate, and entertain ourselves. However, it is important to use computers responsibly and to ensure that they are properly secured. With the advancement of technology, computers will become even more powerful and capable of performing more complex tasks. The future of computers looks very promising, and it is up to us to make sure that we use them for the betterment of society.";"In the modern world of technology, computers have become an integral part of our lives. We use them for a variety of purposes, ranging from educational to recreational. But, as technology advances, computers uses are rapidly becoming more vital. From banking software to medical research, computers have become a ubiquitous tool of productivity.
 
 Today, computers are mostly used for data processing and calculations. This is done through a variety of software and hardware, such as word processors, spreadsheet applications, and graphic programs. Computers are also used for communicating, with the development of the internet, electronic networks, and cellular technologies, we can connect with almost anyone in the world in an instant. Businesses take advantage of this technology to stay ahead of their competitors, while educational institutions use computers to facilitate learning in the classroom.
 
 In the near future, computers may even replace doctors and nurses as medical diagnosis becomes fully automated. With the help of intelligent algorithms and machines, it is becoming possible to accurately identify and diagnose illnesses, giving people access to quick and accurate healthcare. Artificial intelligence may also be used to automate mundane tasks like scheduling appointments, making sure the patients medical record is up to date, and even helping to plan treatments.
 
 The use of computers is set to become even more widespread and sophisticated in the future. Autonomous vehicles are rapidly becoming a reality, while the development of robotics is allowing machines to take on the role of humans in many tasks. We may even see computers that can think like humans, or artificial intelligence (AI) systems that are capable of making decisions and judgments about their environment.
 
 Despite all of the potential benefits, there is a concern about becoming over-dependent on computers. It is important to remember that machines can never replace human judgement and creativity. In the future, computers may be able to mimic certain capabilities, but it is essential that humans use their own skills and knowledge to guide the decision making process.
 
 In conclusion, computers have become an indispensable part of our lives, and their uses are continuing to expand. But, it is important to keep in mind that computers should be used in addition to the human intellect, not as a replacement for it. If we can use computers and humans in tandem, then we can leverage the best of both worlds.";51;2329;2145;2519;2332.0
61;61;essay62.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/should-universities-accept-equal-number-males-females-not-26654/;should universities accept equal number of males/females or not;"Education is important for the development of the world. Its a debatable issue whether universities should accept equal number of males and females in a course or not. However, since both genders are equally important, both must be given equal opportunities. Universities must admit both in equal numbers, depending on their choices.
 Right to education is a basic human right of both, males and females. The whole world aims for women empowerment, and to achieve this, females should be given equal opportunities as males. When universities will accept them in equal number, both genders will be able to nurture their talent and a healthy competitive environment will develop.
 Co-education helps both genders to gel well with each other. It helps them how to behave and cooperate and work together. For example, students studying in boy's colleges do not generally know how to talk to a female or behave in front of them. On the other hand, females studying in girl's colleges are too shy to face boys. Co-education will help to eradicate this kind of demerit in both. Universities giving both genders equal opportunities, will prepare then for future challenges and will help in the long run.
 Unfortunately, some male chauvinists think that women are incapable in particular fields, like maths, mechanical engineering, defence etc. This kind of gender biased approach is detrimental for the development of the society. Time and again, women have proved their mettle in every field. Women like Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, Mari Curie etc., are symbols of women's intelligence and skills.
 Thus, I firmly believe that both genders have equal rights and universities should accept them in equal numbers. Equality in education will help in development of the society.Both genders are the fulcrum of the society and none of them is superior or inferior. Choice of course should be the discretion of the student and their merit, irrespective of the gender. Educational rights must be given to both genders.
";"The debate over whether universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students has been ongoing for many years. On one hand, there are those who argue that universities should strive for gender parity in order to promote equality and fairness. On the other hand, there are those who argue that universities should not accept equal numbers of male and female students, as this could lead to a decrease in academic standards.
 
 Proponents of gender parity in universities argue that it is essential for universities to accept equal numbers of male and female students in order to promote gender equality. They point out that universities should be a place where all students are given an equal opportunity to succeed, regardless of their gender. Furthermore, they argue that gender parity would help to reduce the gender gap in higher education, which has been a persistent problem in many countries.
 
 Opponents of gender parity in universities argue that it could lead to a decrease in academic standards. They point out that universities should strive to accept the best students, regardless of their gender. Furthermore, they argue that gender parity could lead to a decrease in competition, as universities would be less likely to accept the most qualified students if they had to accept equal numbers of male and female students.
 
 Ultimately, the decision of whether universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students is a complex one. On one hand, universities should strive to promote gender equality and fairness. On the other hand, universities should strive to accept the best students, regardless of their gender. Ultimately, universities should strive to find a balance between these two goals in order to ensure that they are providing the best education possible.";"The issue of gender equality in higher education has been a topic of debate for many years. The question of whether universities should accept equal numbers of males and females is one that has not been adequately answered with a universal response. This essay will explore the arguments in favor and against this idea, and will ultimately argue that universities should strive for gender balance, but the implementation of such a policy should take into account the needs of the particular university and its students.
 
 The primary argument in support of equal male/female enrollment is that it is necessary to ensure a diverse and balanced learning environment. Gender diversity in a learning environment can bring a wide range of perspectives and experiences to the discussion, making the classroom environment richer and more productive. Furthermore, it provides an educational experience that reflects the makeup of the wider world, and can help reduce the gender gap in many academic and professional fields.
 
 Despite the useful outcomes of equal gender enrollment, there are also some drawbacks that must not be overlooked. For example, some universities may not have the resources or capacity to handle an equally divided enrollment of male and female students. This could lead to overcrowding or an unbalanced student population, leading to lower quality education. Furthermore, certain disciplines may be dominated by males or females due to historical trends or cultural norms, meaning that the pursuit of gender balance could result in an unrepresentative student body in those areas.
 
 Ultimately, a one size fits all approach to gender equality in higher education is not appropriate. Universities should strive for gender balance, but the implementation of such policies should depend on the particular university and student body, taking into account the specific needs and dynamics of each institution. Moreover, there should be an emphasis on providing equal opportunity and encouraging a diverse student population, rather than enforcing hard quotas on gender enrollment. 
 
 In conclusion, universities should strive for gender balance, but the implementation of such policies should be tailored to the particular institution and its students. Gender equality is essential to providing a high-quality education, but this can only be achieved if the complex needs of each university are properly taken into account.";63;2010;1812;2439;2125.5
62;62;essay63.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/task-people-spend-less-time-cooking-food-28132/;people will spend less time on cooking food;"Perhaps, no issue in this world is as significant to people as cooking food, because it affects everybody in their daily lives. Some people hold the opinion that people should spend much time on food. However, I do think that people are likely to spend less time in cooking food. There are various reasons why I maintain this viewpoint, and among those reasons are two important ones.
 The first and foremost reason is that with the development of science and technology, more advanced kitchen facilities, such as the modern microwaves or the advanced pressure cookers, have been created and invented to help people prepare and cook food in a very short time. As a result, people nowadays just spend one hour to prepare a meal instead of two, even three hours like in the last 10 years. Actually, in recent years, there was a significant increase in the number of people from all walks of life realizing this valueable benefit of those technologies in doing their housework. And this figure still continueously go up along with the improvement of science and technology. Thus, it is certain that spending less time on cooking will be the main trend in near future.
 Another reason is that most of young people prefer to have meals at restaurants because they want to invest more time in their work or study to improve themselves. According to a recent survey, 89% of people have come to think that, since they have been put in the situation which is filled with competitions and pressures, they have to use a lot of time to work hard, to update themselves, to acquire all kinds of skills and so on. Thus, they find hard to have time to prepare and cook a meal. Even they have some spare time, they prefer to go out with friends to relax and relieve the pressure from work and study.
 Some people may argue that investing much time in cooking food will guarantee nutrition as well as quality of food for their family. To some extent, it is true. However, as a matter of fact, using technology or advanced facilities do not make food lose its nutrition and quality. Even, with the help of ozone machines, bacterias, mold spores, or pesticide in vegetables, fruits and foods will be killed and removed, thus health and life of eaters is assured. Besides, along with the high living standard, requirements of quality products in almost restaurants, nowadays, are under severe control and supervision by appropriate authorities. Consequently, it is quite easy to have a nutritious meal with guaranteed quality, but do not waste a lot of time.
 To sum up, if all those factors are contemplated, it is obviously found that there are many solid reasons to support my viewpoint. So, from what have been discussed above, I strongly affirm the conclusion that people will spend less time in cooking food.
";"In recent years, people have been spending less time on cooking food. This is due to a variety of factors, including the rise of convenience foods, the increased availability of take-out and delivery options, and the emergence of new technologies that make food preparation easier and faster.
 
 Convenience foods have become increasingly popular in recent years, as they are quick and easy to prepare. These foods are often pre-packaged and require minimal preparation. For example, frozen meals can be heated in the microwave in a matter of minutes, and canned soups and stews can be heated on the stovetop in just a few minutes. This makes it easy for people to have a meal ready in a short amount of time, without having to spend a lot of time in the kitchen.
 
 Take-out and delivery options have also become increasingly popular. Many restaurants now offer delivery services, and there are a variety of apps and websites that make it easy to order food from the comfort of home. This makes it easy for people to get a meal without having to spend time in the kitchen.
 
 Finally, new technologies have made food preparation easier and faster. For example, the emergence of sous vide cooking has made it possible to cook food quickly and evenly. Additionally, the rise of the slow cooker has made it possible to prepare meals in a fraction of the time it would take to cook them on the stovetop.
 
 Overall, people are spending less time on cooking food due to the rise of convenience foods, the increased availability of take-out and delivery options, and the emergence of new technologies that make food preparation easier and faster. This trend is likely to continue in the future, as people continue to look for ways to save time in the kitchen.";"The modern world has seen a rapid evolution of technology, changing how people approach everyday tasks. In particular, the means to produce and cook food has seen a dramatic revolution with the rise of pre-packaged food, home delivery services, and ready-made meals. As a result, people are now spending less time on cooking food than ever before.
 
 The primary reason for this decrease in cooking time is accessibility. Previous generations had to spend considerable time sourcing and obtaining ingredients, or relying on local food sources, making cooking from scratch a time-consuming process. However, today, an immense variety of convenience foods, from frozen pizzas to take-out noodles, can be delivered to a persons door within a matter of hours. This has drastically reduced the time people need to spend buying ingredients, preparing them and finally cooking the food- all of which can be avoided and still yield a quality result. 
 
 These convenience foods are also proven to be more cost effective than cooking from scratch. Ready-made meals require less energy to cook- microwaves, toaster ovens, and the like replacing ovens and stovetops- which ultimately reduces the total cost of food. Time can also be saved by not having to clean up.
 
 Another factor is the rise in eating out. With so many enticing dining options available, people are choosing to eat out more often than they used to. Though this doesn't necessarily equate to less time spent cooking, it is an alternative that isn't as time-consuming. 
 
 Overall, the massive advancements in the food production and cooking industry have certainly improved convenience and quality of life. People now have more options than ever when it comes to preparing meals, and don't need to spend as much time doing so. This allows people to focus on other aspects of their day, or spend more time with their loved ones- something that wasn't available to previous generations.";43;2794;1754;1943;1848.5
63;63;essay64.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/traditional-games-modern-games-developing-children-s-skills-28714/;Traditional games or modern games in developing children's skills;"Games have played a key role in children's growth, especially in terms of their abilities. With technological advances, children have more access to modern games currently. In such case, the relative importance of traditional games and modern games in children's developments of skills has become a frequent topic of discussion. For me, I believe parents and educators should attach more importance to traditional games.
 It is true that modern games may be, to some extent, beneficial for children to foster some skills, such as computer skills or the capacity to keep up with the latest trend. This is because children have to be proficient at computers and the Internet if they want to join online games, which, in fact, helps children acquire a particularly powerful skill at work in future. At the same time, children have the chance to experience the state-of-the-art technology, raising their awareness of innovation rather than stay conservative.
 However, I think traditional games are still indispensible in children's learning process, even much more essential than modern games, especially in modern society. One primary merit of traditional games is that they foster children's communication skills. Unlike most modern games which focus on the interactions between children and machines, traditional games provide a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere where children can chat, laugh and cooperate face to face. As a result, communicating with a variety of people will not be an issue for these children any more.
 Furthermore, it is the educational functions traditional games hold that keep them alive today. In fact, these traditional games were elaborately devised by educators and have been proven effective in improving children's skills on different aspects in previous teaching practices. By contrast, modern games are developed by game companies for the purpose of profits. Therefore, there is a risk that children may be exposed to unhealthy contents, such as violence or pornography, arranged in the games by such companies to secure financial survival.
 Thus, I would conclude that traditional games should be, by no means, ignored by parents and teachers with the advent of modern games. Only through traditional games can children be ensured a positive and healthy skills learning process.
";"The debate between traditional and modern games in developing children's skills has been ongoing for many years. Traditional games have been around for centuries and have been passed down through generations, while modern games have become increasingly popular in recent years. Both types of games have their own unique advantages and disadvantages when it comes to developing children's skills.
 
 Traditional games are often seen as more beneficial for developing children's skills. These games are often more interactive and require more physical activity than modern games. This physical activity helps children to develop their motor skills, coordination, and balance. Traditional games also require more social interaction, which can help children to develop their communication and social skills. Additionally, traditional games often require more strategy and problem-solving skills, which can help to develop children's cognitive abilities.
 
 On the other hand, modern games can also be beneficial for developing children's skills. These games often require more mental activity than traditional games, which can help to develop children's cognitive abilities. Additionally, modern games often require more technical skills, such as the ability to use a controller or keyboard, which can help to develop children's fine motor skills. Furthermore, modern games often have a greater variety of content, which can help to develop children's creativity.
 
 Overall, both traditional and modern games can be beneficial for developing children's skills. Traditional games often require more physical activity and social interaction, while modern games often require more mental activity and technical skills. Ultimately, the type of game that is best for developing children's skills will depend on the individual child and their interests.";"When it comes to the development of a child's skills, parents often debate whether traditional or modern games yield a better result. Traditional games such as hopscotch and tag have been around for years, whilst modern games such as video games and apps are increasingly popular due to their endless variety and convenience. Each type of game has its own unique set of benefits, making one suitable for particular skills and the other suitable for other skills. 
 
 Firstly, traditional games such as tag and hopscotch bring certain benefits, particularly with regard to physical skills. Playing outdoor games encourages children to use their motor skills and can help improve coordination and balance. Furthermore, traditional games encourage teamwork and social skills such as cooperation and communication. Traditional games also require concentration and focus, helping to develop cognitive abilities and emotional intelligence. Finally, traditional games are enjoyable and can help to reduce stress. 
 
 On the other hand, modern games can help children build skills in a variety of ways. Video games, for example, can help to develop problem-solving skills as children must think strategically in order to complete objectives. Moreover, modern games can help to develop hand-eye coordination as children must often react quickly to events that occur on-screen. In addition, modern games can help to improve memory and concentration as players must remember and recall key elements in order to progress. Furthermore, modern games can help children to express their creativity as they can create their own stories and characters. 
 
 In conclusion, it is clear that traditional and modern games both provide their own unique set of benefits when it comes to developing children's skills. Whilst traditional games help to improve concentration and teamwork, modern games can help to improve problem-solving and hand-eye coordination. Ultimately, the best option for parents is to provide a mixture of both traditional and modern games in order to ensure their child has access to a wide range of skills to develop.";65;2314;1844;2118;1981.0
64;64;essay65.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/government-shouldn-t-put-money-building-theaters-sports-28690/;government shouldn't put money on building theaters or sports stadiums;"How to allocate governmental budget efficiently has always been a hot topic of discussion among the public. Recently, some people argue that government should invest more on medical care and education rather than on entertaining or sports facilities. As far as I am concerned, this proposal is beneficial more to the society.
 Taking care of thousands of citizens who suffer from disease or illiteracy is more urgent and pragmatic than building theaters or sports stadiums. As a matter of fact, an uneducated person may barely appreciate musicals, whereas a physical damaged person, resulting from the lack of medical treatment, may no longer participate in any sports games. Therefore, providing education and medical care is more essential and prioritized to the government.
 Entertaining facilities such as cinemas, theaters and sports stadiums are mostly profit-oriented. Their existences are based on their marketing strategies, the condition of facilities and the volume of audience. The competition among each of these facilities is an inevitable part of the free market, which should not be interfered by government. Instead, the establishment of medical facilities or educational institutes is aimed to improve the health or education standard rather than earning profits, which deserves more funds from government.
 Furthermore, putting taxpayers' money on building theaters or sports stadiums is unfair to those who cannot use them. For example, not everyone is a fan of watching musicals on the spot. Therefore, it is a bit inappropriate to use the majority of citizens' tax funds to meet a minority of people's needs. That is the reason why sectors such as medical care and education deserve more governmental support, because they are accessed by every individual in our society on a daily basis.
 To summarize, I strongly agree that budgets should be allocated more on medical care and education rather than on building entertaining facilities, because the former is more essential, non-profit oriented to the public and can be accessed by the majority of citizens.
";"The government should not put money into building theaters or sports stadiums. This is because there are more important uses for public funds, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure.
 
 Theaters and sports stadiums are not essential to the functioning of society. They are luxuries that can be enjoyed by those who can afford them. The government should not be using public funds to subsidize these luxuries. Instead, the money should be used to fund essential services that benefit the entire population.
 
 Education is one of the most important services the government should be funding. Investing in education is an investment in the future of the nation. It is essential for the development of a well-educated and skilled workforce, which is necessary for a prosperous economy. Investing in education also helps to reduce poverty and inequality, as it gives people the opportunity to improve their lives and the lives of their families.
 
 Healthcare is another essential service that the government should be funding. Healthcare is a basic human right and should be accessible to everyone. Investing in healthcare helps to reduce the burden of disease and illness, which can have a positive impact on the economy. It also helps to reduce poverty and inequality, as access to healthcare is essential for people to lead healthy and productive lives.
 
 Finally, the government should be investing in infrastructure. Infrastructure is essential for the functioning of society. It is necessary for transportation, communication, and the delivery of essential services. Investing in infrastructure helps to create jobs, stimulate economic growth, and improve the quality of life for citizens.
 
 In conclusion, the government should not be putting money into building theaters or sports stadiums. These are luxuries that should be funded by private individuals or businesses. Instead, the government should be investing in essential services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. These investments will benefit the entire population and help to create a more prosperous and equitable society.";"The government should not use public funds to build theaters and sports stadiums. Despite the potential economic benefits that such public works might bring, there are better and more pressing uses for such funds, and many issues that need to be taken into account when making such a decision. 
 
 First, there are the costs of building theaters and sports stadiums. Costs can include the purchase of land, construction materials, and labor. Depending on the size and scope of the project, the cost can be quite significant. This can be a huge burden on the government, especially when there are more pressing concerns, such as infrastructure and public health. 
 
 Second, theaters and sports stadiums are often subsidized by the government, meaning that the money used is not being used to create a meaningful benefit to its citizens. Instead, it is being spent on projects that often bring few jobs or tax revenue to the local economy. On top of this, many stadiums and theaters are rarely used and quickly become forgotten, making them a poor use of public funds. 
 
 Finally, the government should focus its resources on projects that will benefit its citizens in the long run. A theater or sports stadium may be able to bring in some short-term revenue, but this is often not enough to offset the costs, and it does not necessarily create a lasting benefit. Funding public health, education, infrastructure, and other projects that will benefit people in the long run is a much better use of public funds than building a theater or sports stadium. 
 
 In conclusion, public funds should not be used to build theaters or sports stadiums. Not only is the cost of such projects a burden on the government, but they are rarely used, do not bring in a lasting benefit, and are often subsidized by the public. Cost-benefit analysis should be conducted in order to determine what projects the government should fund, and building theaters and sports stadiums should not be at the top of the list.";70;2081;2117;1995;2056.0
65;65;essay66.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/technology-keeps-traditional-skills-ways-life-alive-not-28686/;Technology keeps traditional skills and ways of life alive or not?;"Living in the 21st century, people are firmly convinced that technology is the main driving force behind productivity. Thus, every country has been promoting technological advances in the recent years, regardless of any potential problems it may bring about. Some people are worried modern technological technology is probably a hurdle to the preservation of traditional techniques and lifestyles. However, I believe their concern is groundless. Instead, technology plays a key role in promoting traditional techniques and lifestyles.
 In terms of time and space, technology makes it more efficient and effective to promote the traditional skills and ways of life. In the past, only when people went to the local place could they experience the specific traditional lifestyles. This means individuals who were engaged in work and therefore could not spare time to travel or restricted by traffic conditions had to miss the chance to appreciate the traditional skills. However, with the access to the Internet, one of the greatest innovations in modern society, humankind can acquire the traditional techniques displayed online anytime, anywhere.
 Additionally, technology enriches the way of displaying traditional cultural heritage, making it more vivid and appealing. For example, China has successfully promoted traditional techniques in the Shanghai World Expo, using a variety of state-of –the-art technological methods, such as robots and LED screens. In fact, many tourists around the world marveled at the perfect synthesis of the modern technology and the traditional culture.
 On the other hand, some people are concerned that technology may have a detrimental effect on the traditional lifestyles. They argue that people, especially youngsters, are crazier about fresh and advanced things, such as digital products, thus becoming indifferent to traditional techniques. But I believe this is not the issue because people tend to follow the trend back to the tradition in the recent years.
 Therefore, I will conclude that technology indeed supports the preservation and promotion of traditional techniques and lifestyles. Only when traditional culture is integrated with the modern technology can it be developed in the long run.
";"Technology has become an integral part of our lives and has had a profound impact on the way we live. It has enabled us to do things faster, more efficiently, and with greater accuracy. But, has it also had an impact on traditional skills and ways of life? This essay will explore the ways in which technology has both helped and hindered traditional skills and ways of life.
 
 On the one hand, technology has enabled us to preserve traditional skills and ways of life. For example, the internet has allowed us to access information about traditional crafts and skills, such as weaving, pottery, and woodworking. This has enabled us to learn more about these skills and to pass them on to future generations. Additionally, technology has enabled us to preserve traditional recipes and cooking techniques, which can be shared with others.
 
 On the other hand, technology has also had a negative impact on traditional skills and ways of life. For example, the introduction of machines and automated processes has made many traditional skills and crafts obsolete. This has resulted in a decrease in the number of people who are able to practice these skills, as well as a decrease in the quality of the products that are produced. Additionally, technology has enabled us to access information about traditional skills and ways of life from around the world, which can lead to the homogenization of cultures.
 
 Overall, technology has both helped and hindered traditional skills and ways of life. While it has enabled us to preserve and share these skills and ways of life, it has also made many of them obsolete and has led to the homogenization of cultures. Therefore, it is important to be mindful of the impact that technology has on traditional skills and ways of life, and to ensure that these skills and ways of life are preserved and celebrated.";"In our modern age of unprecedented technological growth, many traditional skills and ways of life have been threatened. With the increased accessibility of computers, internet, and other modern technologies, various traditional crafts and traditions have become less popular. However, despite the challenges posed by this technological revolution, it is possible that technology can also help to keep traditional skills and ways of life alive.
 
 To begin with, technology has allowed us to share knowledge and skills more effectively and precisely. For example, the use of video tutorials and online courses has enabled experts from around the world to transmit their skills and expertise to others. Through modern technology, craftspeople and traditional experts of various traditional trades like textiles or blacksmithing can impart their knowledge to others much more efficiently and accurately than ever before. With access to the internet, anyone can learn a variety of traditional skills and crafts with ease. This is a huge advantage, as it allows traditional skills to be passed on to future generations, thus ensuring that these skills do not become extinct.
 
 Furthermore, technology can be used to document, protect and promote traditional ways of life and cultures. For example, digital platforms like museums, websites, and even smartphone apps can be used to capture, store, and share the knowledge and stories behind traditional communities and cultures. This is useful in preserving the characteristics and values of these communities and cultures that would otherwise be forgotten. Additionally, modern technology can be used to document cultural heritage sites and landmarks such as archaeological ruins, giving greater visibility to these important sites.
 
 Finally, technology can be used to introduce traditional skills into new markets and make them more relevant to society. For example, technology can be used to promote traditional skills and make them more attractive to modern consumers. Through social media platforms, traditional craftspeople can reach larger audiences and, in turn, increase their market reach. Additionally, technology can be used to develop modern applications for traditional skills, thus making them more commercially viable.
 
 In conclusion, technology can indeed be used to keep traditional skills and ways of life alive. Through effective sharing of knowledge, documenting and protecting cultural heritage, and introducing traditional skills into new markets, technology can help to ensure that traditional skills and ways of life do not become extinct. Thus, while technology can undoubtedly pose a threat to traditional skills and ways of life, it can also be a powerful tool in keeping them alive.";66;2240;1852;2759;2305.5
66;66;essay67.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/practice-attempt-creative-artists-28640/;Creative Artists;"Innovative artists bring enjoyment and inspiration to our sometimes tedious life; however, some people deem that artists have been entrusted with too much freedom and power and should be restricted by the government. It is my personal belief that freedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be eulogized and it's rather iniquitous to impose a shackle on artists' will to create.
 One of the major concerns against freeing artists' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society; however, I believe the audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work. It is needless to say that art inevitably involves imagination, exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not, it is the public's authority to determine how to interpret its meaning. If the art displays unreality, the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value; if the art reflects the reality, then what would be the intention to ban it if it was not for covering the dirty truth? Would it be autocratic if the government clamp down the artists who are telling the truth? In a word, the notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified.
 Let's then take a look at the impact that art has posed on individuals. It is undeniable that some of the art work may contain negative implications such as insanity, violence, eroticism etc. I absolutely agree that restrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply as adolescents are not mature enough to avoid being led astray by these contents; however, in the case of adults being the audience, there's really nothing to hide – these negative things objectively exist on this planet and it is impossible for adults to be brain-washed only because of some pieces of creative art.
 By way of conclusion, I do not root for the idea that restrictions should be put on artists work; on the contrary, they should be encouraged to express their innovative ideas – this world needs them to make itself colourful.
";"Creative artists are individuals who use their imagination and skills to create works of art. They are often seen as the most influential people in society, as they are able to express their ideas and emotions through their art. Creative artists can be found in all areas of the arts, from painting and sculpture to music and literature.
 
 Creative artists have the ability to bring beauty and emotion to the world. They are able to capture the essence of a moment or a feeling and express it in a way that is unique and powerful. Through their art, they can tell stories, evoke emotions, and create a lasting impression on the viewer. Creative artists often use their art to make a statement or to express their own personal beliefs.
 
 Creative artists are also able to use their art to inspire and motivate others. Through their work, they can encourage people to think differently, to take risks, and to explore new ideas. Creative artists often use their art to challenge the status quo and to push boundaries. They can also use their art to bring attention to important social issues and to create awareness of the need for change.
 
 Creative artists are often seen as the pioneers of their field. They are constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible and exploring new ideas. They are often the first to try something new, and their work can be an inspiration to others. Creative artists are also often seen as the innovators of their field, as they are constantly finding new ways to express themselves and to create something unique.
 
 Creative artists are essential to the development of society. They are able to bring beauty and emotion to the world, and to inspire and motivate others. They are also able to challenge the status quo and to push boundaries. Creative artists are essential to the progress of society, and their work should be celebrated and appreciated.";"Creative artists have the unique task of creating works that inspire, provoke thought, and challenge the norms of the prevailing culture. Not all works of art are created equal, and a truly creative artist is able to reach an audience and move them in ways that traditional and conventional works of art cannot. Creative artists push boundaries and create works of art that challenge the status quo, introducing new ideas and perspectives to the world.
 
 Creative artists also have a responsibility to their craft and to the audience. They must be willing to take risks in order to create works that are thought-provoking and that speak to their viewers. This means that they must be willing to fail, or to take criticism, in order to create something that speaks to a larger audience. Additionally, creative artists must be willing to look inward and explore new ideas, even when these ideas may not be popular or accepted by the mass public.
 
 Creative artists have an important role to play in our society. Their works bring a broader understanding of the world around us, and provide new insights and perspectives. They can challenge the status quo and push boundaries, creating works that are truly unique and that can make a difference in the world. They can be a source of inspiration and motivation, giving people hope and courage to pursue their own dreams and ambitions.
 
 Creative artists have a rich history and tradition, and have been creating works for centuries. Their works can be an important source of education and enlightenment, and can serve to remind us of our shared humanity. By creating works that explore different cultures and traditions, creative artists can provide us with a greater understanding of the world around us, and inspire us to make changes in our own lives and in the world.";16;2146;1893;1820;1856.5
67;67;essay68.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/should-goverment-control-media-crime-28414/;should goverment control media crime;"The soaring crime rate has led to the proposal that it is time for the government to take action to control the proliferation of violent scenes in media.
 Obviously, violence in the media is often portrayed as extreme as possible in order to attract audiences. This will definitely set a bad example for the immature audiences who, lacking correct parental guidance and abilities to differentiate the right from wrong, are prone to go astray by imitating the violent behaviours and committing real violent crimes as they regard the violence as reasonable and justifiable.
 On the other hand, media, such as TV or film, is considered as the correct information source regulated by the government. It should be reporting and reflecting true phenomenon in the society. Violence, as one of the facts in the real world, certainly has to be reported. However, excessive violence would offer misleading information to the public and exert detrimental influence to the society as well. It is recently reported in the news that a seventeen-year-old boy killed all his family members, one sister and two parents out of hatred and jealousy. In the real world, we are inclined to take extreme approach to tackle a small problem due to excessive violence exposure.
 We cannot deny that our society is occupied with the violent scenes and plots at present. What the government should do immediately is to strengthen censorship to control the amount of violence in media. Otherwise, the violent crime rate will rise continuously and out of control someday.
";"The media has become an integral part of our lives, providing us with news, entertainment, and a platform for communication. As such, it is important to consider the role of government in controlling media crime. Media crime is a broad term that encompasses a variety of offenses, such as copyright infringement, piracy, and cybercrime. In this essay, I will discuss the need for government control of media crime and the potential benefits and drawbacks of such control.
 
 First, it is important to note that media crime is a serious issue that can have serious consequences. Copyright infringement, for example, can lead to significant financial losses for the copyright holder, while piracy can lead to the spread of malicious software and viruses. Cybercrime, meanwhile, can lead to identity theft, financial fraud, and other serious crimes. As such, it is important for governments to take steps to protect citizens from media crime.
 
 One way that governments can control media crime is through the implementation of laws and regulations. These laws and regulations can be used to punish those who commit media crimes, as well as to deter potential offenders. For example, governments can impose fines or jail time for those who commit copyright infringement or piracy. Additionally, governments can create laws that require companies to take steps to protect their customers from cybercrime.
 
 Another way that governments can control media crime is through the use of technology. For example, governments can implement technologies such as digital rights management (DRM) systems to protect copyrighted content from being illegally copied or distributed. Additionally, governments can use technologies such as encryption to protect sensitive data from being stolen or accessed by unauthorized individuals.
 
 Finally, governments can also control media crime through public education. By educating citizens about the dangers of media crime, governments can help to reduce the number of people who commit such crimes. Additionally, governments can use public education to raise awareness about the importance of protecting ones personal information and digital assets.
 
 In conclusion, it is clear that government control of media crime is necessary in order to protect citizens from the dangers of such crimes. Governments can control media crime through the implementation of laws and regulations, the use of technology, and public education. While there are potential drawbacks to government control of media crime, such as the potential for censorship, the benefits of such control outweigh the risks.";"In todays digital world, media plays a crucial role in our lives. It is often used as a medium to communicate and to spread awareness. It also has the power to influence public opinion as well as to highlight social issues. However, some people also use media to commit crimes. Therefore, the question arises whether or not the government should control media crime.
 
 On the one hand, some people argue that the government should control media crime. They believe that the government has an obligation to ensure the safety of its citizens by preventing the spread of any potentially damaging information. Furthermore, it is argued that the government can monitor media activities and crack down on any criminal activities that may be taking place through the medium of media.
 
 On the other hand, there are those who believe that governments should not control media crime. They believe that this kind of control could lead to a greater restriction of freedom of speech, as the government might start to censor and limit the information that is presented through the media. Additionally, they claim that media crime is often difficult to track and monitor, and attempting to control it would be a waste of resources.
 
 Overall, it is clear that the government should control media crime to a certain extent. It is vital that the government ensures the safety of its citizens and prevents potentially damaging information from spreading. It can do this by monitoring certain media activities and cracking down on any illegal activities. However, it is also important to consider that the government should not overstep its bounds and prevent people from sharing their thoughts and ideas freely.";36;1542;2616;1697;2156.5
68;68;essay69.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/nowadays-more-opportunities-women-than-past-28338/;Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past;"The modern times have witnessed profound changes in most aspects of life, including the revolution of feminism. Women have been opened up to more chances than ever. This, contrary to some ideas, is a positive progress in human society from my point of view.
 To start with, the fairness between males and females is inevitable in such a developed society. Gone are the days when women could do nothing rather than stick to boring house work and take care of children. Women nowadays are much more active, they may be successful businessmen, they join the political world, they become scientists and so on. This is to say, the ""weaker"" gender as often be thought has enough right as well as ability to contribute to the development of human beings just like any other men, not to mention they even perform better in some fields.
 In the second place, the revolution in females' right has brought about many benefits not only to themselves but society as well. The financial burden of families, for instance, has decreased significantly with both the wives and the husbands working to earn money. What is more, women have the outstanding instinct to take up some careers lie healthcare or human resource management due to their patience and elaboration.
 Admittedly, such changes do lead to some negative results like an upward trend in divorce rate or, under many circumstances, women find it difficult to balance their work and their traditional role as the wives. Also, children might enjoy less care from parents as they arre both busy with theit work. Yet everything has it upside and downside, women should find the best way to overcome such challenges.
 All things considered, in a society where females are given equal opportunities compared with males would obviously enjoy lots of benefits far outweighing its obstacles.
";"Nowadays, there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past. This is due to the fact that society has become more accepting of women in the workforce and in leadership roles. Women are now able to pursue careers in traditionally male-dominated fields, such as engineering, medicine, and law. Additionally, women are now able to pursue higher education and obtain degrees in fields such as business, finance, and computer science.
 
 The increased opportunities for women are also due to the fact that there are now more laws in place to protect womens rights in the workplace. For example, the Equal Pay Act of 1963 made it illegal for employers to pay women less than men for the same job. Additionally, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 made it illegal for employers to discriminate against women based on their gender. These laws have helped to create a more level playing field for women in the workplace.
 
 Furthermore, the increased opportunities for women are also due to the fact that there is now more awareness of the importance of gender equality. This has led to more companies and organizations taking steps to ensure that women are given equal opportunities and are treated fairly in the workplace. For example, many companies now have policies in place to ensure that women are given equal pay and are not discriminated against based on their gender. Additionally, many companies have implemented programs to help women advance in their careers.
 
 In conclusion, there are now more opportunities for women than there were in the past. This is due to the fact that society has become more accepting of women in the workforce, there are now more laws in place to protect womens rights, and there is now more awareness of the importance of gender equality. These changes have helped to create a more level playing field for women in the workplace and have allowed them to pursue careers in traditionally male-dominated fields.";"Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past, mainly because of the progress in the legislation, technology, and education. Better access to education, more career options, and the development of technology have had a positive effect on the ability of women to pursue their goals.
 
 In the past, women had limited rights and limited access to educational opportunities. Women were generally limited to traditional roles such as housekeeping and child rearing. This lack of education as well as traditional beliefs and values kept many women from achieving their full potential. Fortunately, times have changed, and women have been given the same rights as men. They have access to educational opportunities such as higher education and have been given the right to work in any field of their choice. This has enabled them to pursue their goals and make their own life choices.
 
 Technology has enabled women to be more independent than ever before. The internet and mobile phones have given women unprecedented access to information and resources. This technology has made it easier for women to find and access educational programs, job opportunities, and business resources. In addition, technology has opened up new career options for women as well as providing them with more control and flexibility in their jobs.
 
 The progress in education has also had a positive impact on the opportunities for women. Women now have access to higher education and can pursue professional degrees such as medicine, engineering, and law. This has opened up a variety of career options for women that were not available in the past.
 
 In conclusion, there are now more opportunities available for women than there were in the past. Women have the rights to pursue any education or career they choose. They have access to resources and technologies to make their dreams come true. All of this has been made possible by the progress we have made in the way we think and treat women. We have come a long way, but there is still much work to be done to make sure that women have the same rights and opportunities as men.";75;1829;1952;2140;2046.0
69;69;essay70.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/growing-traffic-pollution-controlled-increasing-petrol-28336/;Growing traffic & pollution can be controlled by increasing petrol prices;"As we read newspapers or watch TV, we have always been attracted by environmental problems such as traffic issues, air and water pollution questions. Initiatives should be taken to address the specific problems. As the impacts for those pollution and traffic issues are extremely far-reaching, it is insufficient to increase the petrol price only to solve problems, though it is a promising method discussed in the contemporary society.
 Specifically, price control institution has been used in plenty of social areas, for example, in the farming products and in the real estate area; however, whether it can work out for alleviating traffic and pollution pressure ought to be evaluated. On one hand, governments have a macro-economic perspective to control price in various areas according to social demands. Consequently, it seems not easy to increase petrol price instantly. On the other hand, pollutions are not just caused by the burning of oil, chemical pollutants, extra lights, also constitute considerable amount of pollution. In addition, the improvements of work efficiency also attribute to the speed-up of working pace, resulting in traffic jams during rush-hours.
 As illustrated before, several other solutions can be introduced to assist in reducing pollution and traffic problems. Primarily, authorities should spare no efforts in improving public transportation facilities, such as constructing more bus lines, in order to reducing the usage of private cars. Furthermore, temporarily targets should be set, with regard to the limitations of pollutants in a certain period of time, for example, a season. Plus with supervisory institutions built to find and address problems. Meanwhile, cultivating a sense of environmental protection would also work out, though it might not be into effect immediately, but in the long run, it would be a wise choice.
 In conclusion, addressing pollution and traffic issues only by increasing oil price Is not adequate, while improving transportation facilities and building supervisory institution would be preferable, plus with the awareness of environmental protection being raised.
";"The world is facing a major environmental crisis due to the growing traffic and pollution. The increasing number of vehicles on the roads is one of the major contributors to this problem. The emissions from these vehicles are causing air pollution, which is leading to health problems and global warming. In order to address this issue, one of the solutions that has been proposed is to increase petrol prices.
 
 The main reason why increasing petrol prices can help to control traffic and pollution is that it will make it more expensive for people to use their vehicles. This will lead to people using their vehicles less often, which will reduce the number of vehicles on the roads. This in turn will reduce the amount of emissions from these vehicles, leading to a decrease in air pollution. Additionally, it will also encourage people to use public transport more often, which is a much more efficient and environmentally friendly way of travelling.
 
 Furthermore, increasing petrol prices can also help to reduce the amount of money that people spend on fuel. This will lead to people having more money to spend on other things, such as education and healthcare. This will help to improve the quality of life for people living in developing countries, which will in turn help to reduce poverty.
 
 In conclusion, increasing petrol prices can be an effective way to control traffic and pollution. It will reduce the number of vehicles on the roads, leading to a decrease in air pollution. Additionally, it will also help to reduce the amount of money that people spend on fuel, which will lead to more money being available for other important things. Therefore, increasing petrol prices is an important step that needs to be taken in order to address the growing traffic and pollution problem.";"As the world population continues to grow, traffic and pollution levels naturally increase with it. This phenomenon is proving to be unsustainable, and drastic measures are being taken to protect the environment. One of these measures is the potential to increase petrol prices, which could be effective in reducing traffic and pollution. 
 
 At the core of this solution, increasing petrol prices serves as an incentive to discourage people from using their cars regularly. The hike in petrol prices makes it more expensive to operate cars, so people are more likely to opt for public transportation, biking or walking instead. If the cost of petrol is simply too high, it could also lead to the emergence of more efficient, eco-friendly vehicles such as electric cars or hybrid cars, thereby reducing the total amount of emissions.
  
 Moreover, the increased petrol prices can be used to fund alternative forms of transportation, such as bus lanes or dedicated bike paths. These options provide an eco-friendly way to get around and also reduce the amount of traffic on the roads in general. Additionally, governments can use the funds created by higher petrol prices to provide more public transportation options and subsidies for cost-effective transportation options that would normally be too expensive for the average person. 
 
 In conclusion, increasing petrol prices is an effective way to reduce traffic and pollution. It serves as an incentive for people to opt for more efficient and eco-friendly transportation options, and it can also be used to fund alternative forms of transportation. This strategy has the potential to create a sustainable balance between population growth and the environment.";73;2137;1801;1714;1757.5
70;70;essay71.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/should-all-advertisements-banned-29250/;should all the advertisements be banned?;"Never in history was advertising industry so developed as in modern society and it has led to some adverse sentiments in public because some deliver exaggerated and fake information. Hence whether we should ban all the advertisements or not has aroused much controversy of the public. My view is that while some of them are disturbing, we can not overlook other merits the advertisements bring.
 First, it is unfair to restrict those public service advertisements which are creative and inspiring. In fact, they are not in the purpose of making profits but taking a role of disseminating valued culture, good moral traits and calling for helps for the disabled and the poor.
 Besides, it is obvious that publicizing brand image or a particular product of mass media could boost sales for companies. In a larger sense, it could simulate household spending and therefore promote the economic development of the whole country. A recent study shows that after launching an advertising campaign, the sales revenue would increase by 40%, which is the very fact to verify its positive influences on economic.
 That is not to say, however, that advertisements have no downsides. Of course, the advertising expenses lead to a higher product price and some of them express fake information, creating information asymmetry between consumers and companies. Yet, its merits still outweigh these downsides.
 Taken all together, advertisements have its social responsibility and contribute to economic growth. We can not deny all of them. However, if those with exaggerated and fake information could be banned, advertisements would be welcomed by more.
";"Advertising is a powerful tool used by businesses and organizations to promote their products and services. It is an effective way to reach out to potential customers and increase sales. However, there is a growing debate over whether all advertisements should be banned. This essay will explore both sides of the argument and provide a conclusion.
 
 On one hand, some people argue that all advertisements should be banned because they are often misleading and manipulative. Advertisements often use persuasive language and exaggerated claims to make products seem more desirable than they really are. This can lead to people making uninformed decisions and buying products that are not suitable for their needs. Furthermore, advertisements can be intrusive and distracting, especially when they are placed in public spaces such as bus stops and train stations.
 
 On the other hand, there are those who argue that advertisements should not be banned because they provide important information to consumers. Advertisements can help people make informed decisions by providing them with information about products and services. They can also help businesses to reach out to potential customers and increase sales. Furthermore, advertisements can be entertaining and can help to create a sense of community.
 
 In conclusion, it is clear that there are both pros and cons to the debate over whether all advertisements should be banned. While advertisements can be misleading and intrusive, they can also provide important information to consumers and help businesses to reach out to potential customers. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide whether or not they want to be exposed to advertisements.";"Advertising is everywhere in the modern world. From billboards to radio and television commercials, companies are constantly pushing their products and services on an unsuspecting public.But should all ads be banned? The answer is a resounding no. Ads are an important part of the marketplace and can be beneficial if used responsibly.
 
 Advertising is a part of todays society. It informs the public of new products or services and creates a need for them. It provides employment opportunities to those in the advertising field, helps support the economy and it can even encourage civic duty by promoting public service campaigns. All these benefits contribute to a healthier economy.
 
 Ads are also a source of entertainment. Many people enjoy the humorous and creative messages that ads convey. They often entertain and provide a distraction from our daily lives. In addition, ads can be educational, providing information about causes and issues that society needs to know about.
 
 However, not all advertising is beneficial. Many ads are misleading, targeting consumers with false claims or deceptive visuals. Ads that target children can be especially dangerous by encouraging them to purchase products that can be unhealthy or inappropriate for their age. Ads that use stereotypes or that promote gender roles can be harmful and offensive.
 
 The key to responsible advertising is regulation. Advertisements should be held to a high standard when it comes to accuracy and decency. Companies should be held accountable for their ads and should be fined or suspended when they break the rules. Advertising should also be monitored to ensure that it is age-appropriate.
 
 In conclusion, all advertisements should not be banned, as they provide many benefits. However, they should be regulated to ensure the accuracy and decency of the ads that are produced. By following these guidelines, ads can continue to provide a useful and entertaining part of society without causing harm.";40;1639;1710;1988;1849.0
71;71;essay72.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/use-drugs-should-automatically-sentenced-time-prison-29213/;Those who use drugs should be automatically sentenced to time in prison;"Today, we no longer fear any contagious diseases, kudos to modern technology and medical advancement. However, it is the contagious behaviors such as addiction and the wrong abuse of drugs that continue to terrorize our society, especially the young ones. It is undeniable that drug addiction is indeed on the rise and effective solutions must be taken in order to trim down the number of drug addicts. Some suggest that it would be better if those caught red-handed using drugs be imprisoned. In my opinion, I disagree to the aforementioned resolution due to the reasons that I will put forward below.
 First of all, I do agree that some of the addicts do turn over a new leaf at the prison. Nevertheless, once they return to the society, they tend to relapse and get involved in drugs again. This is because, in the prisons, there would not be any programs or talks that can enlighten and transform them as well as change their perspectives towards drugs. As such, all the efforts of putting them behind bars are simply in vain. Instead, if the addicts are sent to rehabilitation centres, they will treated for their addiction. On top of that, counselors can provide them with counseling and motivation to help them build a new life.
 On the other hand, some argue that if the drug addicts are not given intense punishment, they will not change and continue to misuse drugs. Nonetheless, I believe that this is mainly due to the society not accepting the prisoners as a part of them. If only the society or the people surrounding the addicts give them a second chance, I am sure that they will never abuse drugs once more. The support alone is not sufficient. They can also report to the concerned parties about any misuse of drugs at the residential areas. Thus, with more public awareness, drug abuse can be certainly be reduced and eventually brought to a halt without having to put the addicts into jail.
 Everyone of us deserves a second chance in life. After all, we are human beings and we learn from our mistakes. Referring to the consequentalist theory, the society should allow leniency for people to experiment and learn, as long as it is on their own expenses. To put it in a nutshell, I believe that sending the drug addicts to rehabilitation centres acts as a beacon of hope for the affected individuals and is also a crucial step in helping them redeem their lives and rejuvenate their lost hopes for a better future rather than sending them to prison.
";"Drug use is a serious problem in our society, and it can have devastating effects on individuals and communities. Those who use drugs should be held accountable for their actions and should be automatically sentenced to time in prison.
 
 The use of drugs can lead to a variety of negative consequences, including physical and mental health problems, addiction, and even death. Drug use can also lead to criminal behavior, such as theft, violence, and other illegal activities. These activities can have a negative impact on the community, and those who use drugs should be held responsible for their actions.
 
 Incarceration is an effective way to deter drug use and to punish those who are caught using drugs. Incarceration serves as a deterrent to those who are considering using drugs, as they know that they could face serious consequences if they are caught. Additionally, incarceration can help to rehabilitate those who are already using drugs, as they will have access to treatment and counseling while in prison.
 
 Incarceration is also a way to protect the public from those who are using drugs. Those who are using drugs are more likely to commit other crimes, and by incarcerating them, they can be kept away from the public and prevented from committing further crimes.
 
 Incarceration is not the only way to address drug use, and other measures, such as treatment and education, should also be considered. However, those who are caught using drugs should be held accountable for their actions and should be automatically sentenced to time in prison. Incarceration is an effective way to deter drug use and to protect the public, and those who use drugs should be held responsible for their actions.";"Drug addiction has been an issue that has plagued the world for an extremely long time, and it has caused nothing but harm and destruction to innocent individuals lives. It is widely accepted that those who use drugs should be held accountable for their actions and decisions. This is why so many people believe that those who use drugs should be automatically sentenced to time in prison. 
 
 The first point that needs to be made regarding whether those who use drugs should be automatically sentenced to time in prison is simply that such an action is necessary to ensure public safety. In many cases, those who are using drugs have become so addicted that they have no other choice than to continue using. This means that their ability to make rational decisions is seriously impaired, and therefore the drugs they are taking could easily lead them to do something dangerous or even illegal, such as rob a store or assault someone. This is why it is so important to ensure that those who use drugs are put in jail where their actions can no longer negatively impact society. 
 
 The second point that needs to be made is that time in prison can actually be a powerful deterrent for those considering using drugs. It is well known that those who are released from prison are often discouraged from ever returning there by the fact that they know very well what the consequences of their actions will be if they do. Knowing this, it is reasonable to assume that those considering taking drugs will be much less likely to do so if they know that they could end up being automatically sentenced to prison for their actions. 
 
 The third point to be made is that by sentencing those who use drugs to time in prison, it can help to address the larger problem of drug addiction. By spending time in prison, those who were using drugs can be given an opportunity to gain treatment and support to help them break their addiction. This is especially important for those who are in desperate need of help and are unable to gain access to the help they need on their own. 
 
 In conclusion, it is clear that those who use drugs should be automatically sentenced to time in prison. Doing so is necessary to ensure public safety, it acts as a powerful deterrent, and it also helps to address the larger problem of drug addiction. It is clear that this is an important step in the fight against drug use and addiction.";71;2470;1716;2408;2062.0
72;72;essay73.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/image-more-powerful-than-written-word-29178/;Is image more powerful than the written word?;"""A picture is worth a thousand words"" is a popular maxim that is being used for a very long time. This strongly depicts the power of images in conveying messages, ideas, or opinions to people. Nevertheless, the importance of written word can never be denied as it is also another way of communication that is commonly used. Hence, I agree only to certain degree that in today's world, image serves as a more effective means of communication.
 Firstly, pictures can influence the way people think. For example, nowadays horrendous images are displayed on the cigarette boxes to illustrate the consequences of smoking. As a result, statistics show a slight reduction in the number of smokers, indicating that they realize the effects of the negative habit. Not only that, the magnificent photograph captured by Kevin Carter, which portrayed a starving Sudanese child struck by extreme poverty has successfully highlighted the plight faced by the citizens in Sudan. Apart from that, images are also widely used in newspapers, magazines and advertisements. Thus, it is undeniable that images in the absence of words can obviously claim the attraction of many.
 Looking from another perspective, written words are also vital in order to spread across certain messages. With only pictures, everyone is left to their own interpretation on how they perceive the images. Nonetheless, this is different when words are used to explain what the illustration is about. Furthermore, the primary way of educating students is also by this way. Academic textbooks these days are laden with words besides pictures to guide the readers to comprehend better.
 To conclude, both images and words go hand in hand and one cannot wholly emphasise on only one aspect, either images or words. Hence, for a more meaningful communication, these two elements have their respective roles to play: image to exemplify and words to describe a particular subject.
";"The debate of whether image or the written word is more powerful has been ongoing for centuries. While both have their merits, it is undeniable that image has a greater impact on the human psyche. Images can evoke emotions and memories in a way that words cannot, and they can be used to convey a message more effectively than words alone.
 
 Images have the power to capture the attention of an audience and draw them in. They can be used to tell a story or convey a message in a way that words alone cannot. Images can evoke emotions and memories in a way that words cannot, and they can be used to create a lasting impression. For example, a picture of a war-torn city can evoke feelings of sadness and despair, while a picture of a happy family can evoke feelings of joy and hope.
 
 Images can also be used to create a sense of urgency. For example, a picture of a starving child can be used to create a sense of urgency and motivate people to take action. Images can also be used to create a sense of unity and solidarity. For example, a picture of a group of people from different backgrounds coming together can be used to create a sense of unity and solidarity.
 
 In contrast, the written word can be used to convey a message, but it lacks the power to evoke emotions and memories in the same way that images can. Words can be used to create a sense of urgency, but they lack the power to create a lasting impression. Words can also be used to create a sense of unity and solidarity, but they lack the power to create a sense of urgency.
 
 Overall, it is clear that image is more powerful than the written word. Images can evoke emotions and memories in a way that words cannot, and they can be used to create a lasting impression. Images can also be used to create a sense of urgency and unity and solidarity. Therefore, it is clear that image is more powerful than the written word.";"Image has long held sway over the written word in terms of its capacity to draw in, captivate, and persuade an audience. In todays digital age, visual media has become an increasingly powerful and pervasive force in our lives, with its impact on how we consume and interact with information continuing to grow. From advertising to news and social media, the ability of a striking image to evoke an emotional reaction or create a strong impression has made it even more powerful than the written word.
 
 In advertising, for instance, a dynamic image can make a statement about a product or brand that conveys much more than words ever could. From a single, memorable image, advertisers can transmit their message in a way that is immediate, far-reaching, and more likely to stick with an audience than a text-based advertisement. The same is true for news imagesa powerful photo can communicate more about a story than any number of words included in an article.
 
 Research has consistently shown that images are better received than words and more likely to create a lasting impression. Studies have found that people are able to process images up to 60,000 times faster than text, making them better suited to conveying important information quickly and efficiently. Moreover, images are far more likely to be remembered than written words. Our brains are wired to remember experiences, and visual images are much more effective in triggering and stimulating an emotional response.
 
 Furthermore, in todays digital age, the reach of visual media is immense. Social media platforms are visual-first experiencesimages are what catch the eye and draw in users. Photos and videos are shared rapidly and widely, making them a powerful tool for spreading messages, ideas, and news stories.
 
 In conclusion, it is clear that image is more powerful than the written word in terms of its ability to capture attention, evoke emotion, create a lasting impression, and stay top-of-mind among audiences. As such, marketers, advertisers, and content creators must be strategic about how they leverage visual media to maximize its potential for influence.";45;1930;1895;2145;2020.0
73;73;essay74.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/several-languages-danger-extinction-29112/;Several languages are in danger of extinction;"It is certainly true that some languages are disappearing day by day over the world. Some people, therefore, harbour a view saying that governments should preserve those by spending some budgets on them. But the others do not believe it is possible. In my opinion, this viewpoint needs to be examined thoroughly and this essay will discuss this issue.
 First and foremost, it is easy to realize that languages, especially oral language, are a quite major part of culture of a country. It helps people distinguish between nations and even regions in a country. The clearance of minority of language means that a national traditional, customs and habitants do not exist. Governments should spend money on keeping and preserving these things for the rich diversity of cultures which make our world more interesting. What is more, it is a pride of the country with a rage of culture which is easy to educate people to love their country more.
 On the other hand, there are some drawbacks from saving minority languages. Although governments invest money on doing that, it is hard to gain the good results. As evidence of this, there are a few people, particularly the youngsters, do not pay attention on collecting and studying those. These kinds of languages are usually difficult and unpopular. In addition, the preservations need a long time to gather, restore all information as well as train in the educational centre. If they do not try their best, their protection can be halted and waste of money.
 In a nutshell, I am convinced that all languages should be preserved and developed as much as possible. All people should give a hand to do this better and governments play a vital role on encouraging and distributing those.
";"In recent years, the number of languages in danger of extinction has been steadily increasing. This is due to a variety of factors, including the spread of globalisation, the rise of English as the global language, and the displacement of indigenous populations. As a result, many languages are in danger of disappearing forever, taking with them centuries of cultural and linguistic heritage.
 
 The loss of a language is a tragedy, not only for the people who speak it, but for the world as a whole. Every language is a unique window into the culture and history of its speakers, and its loss means the loss of a unique perspective on the world. Furthermore, the loss of a language can have a devastating impact on the people who speak it, as it can lead to a loss of identity and a sense of alienation from their own culture.
 
 In order to prevent the extinction of these languages, it is important to take action. Governments, organisations, and individuals can all play a role in preserving endangered languages. Governments can provide funding for language preservation projects, while organisations can provide resources and support to communities in danger of losing their language. Individuals can also help by learning endangered languages, or by supporting language preservation projects.
 
 The preservation of endangered languages is a complex and difficult task, but it is essential if we are to protect the worlds linguistic diversity. By taking action, we can ensure that the unique perspectives and cultures of these languages are not lost forever.";"Languages play a vital role in the transmission of culture, values, and identities of a people. They are the most powerful connectors of humanity, and in a globalized world, they are becoming more and more important. Unfortunately, due to globalization, migration, and technological advancement, many languages are in danger of extinction. It is estimated that one language disappears every two weeks, and by the end of this century, almost half of the currently-spoken languages will be extinct. 
 
 The first contributor to language extinction is globalization. As countries become more interconnected and share a common culture, there is less need for many languages. There is an increasing tendency for people to learn only one or two languages in order to be part of a larger international community. This has had a significant impact on the dissemination of native languages, particularly those spoken by minority groups, who are now becoming increasingly exposed to English and other modern languages.
 
 Another contributor to the decline in some languages is mass migration. As people move from their native countries to more developed ones, they tend to abandon their native languages and assimilate to the culture of their new home. This often leads to a decline in the native language, as it is no longer used as regularly as before.
 
 Finally, technology is also a major player in language extinction. The Internet and other forms of technology have connected people around the world, and many are now able to communicate in a single language, such as English. As a result, there is less need for individual languages, and many are falling into disuse.
 
 It is important to recognize that the death of a language is a cause for great concern. Every language contains knowledge and wisdom that is unique to it, and when these languages are lost, we lose an irreplaceable part of our collective heritage. This is why it is important to take action to conserve these languages and ensure their survival. Governments and organizations should take measures to protect and revitalize these languages, as well as promote the use of them among the younger generations.
 
 In conclusion, the death of languages is a serious issue that needs attention. To ensure the survival of these languages, it is essential that governments and organizations take the necessary steps to protect them and promote their use. This will ensure that these valuable resources are not lost, and that humanity will continue to benefit from the unique contributions of each language.";45;1728;1566;2567;2066.5
74;74;essay75.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/do-arts-music-improve-quality-life-29000/;Do arts and music improve the quality of life?;"My view is that the government should give priorities to invest more money on the basic social welfares such as education and housing instead of subsidizing arts relative programs.
 Art is not the key determination of quality of life, but education is. In order to make people better off, it is more urgent for governments to commit money to some fundamental help such as setting more scholarships in education section for all citizens. This is simply because knowledge and wisdom is the guarantee of the enhancement of the quality of people's lives for a well-rounded social system.
 Admittedly, art, to some extent, serve a valuable function about enriching one's daily lives, for example, it could bring release one's heavy burden of study pressure and refresh human bodies through a hard day from work. However, it is unrealistic to pursuit of this high standard of life in many developing countries, in which the basic housing supply has still been a huge problem with plenty of lower income family have squeezed in a small tight room. By comparison to these issues, the pursuit of art seems unimportant at all.
 To conclude, art could play an active role in improving the quality of people's lives, but I think that governments should attach heavier weight to other social issues such as education and housing needs because those are the most essential ways enable to make people a decent life.
";"The arts and music have long been a source of joy and comfort for people throughout the world. From the earliest days of human civilization, music and art have been used to express emotion, tell stories, and bring people together. In todays world, the arts and music continue to play an important role in improving the quality of life for many people.
 
 The arts and music can be used to bring people together and create a sense of community. Music can be used to celebrate special occasions, such as weddings, birthdays, and holidays. Art can be used to decorate public spaces and create a sense of beauty and harmony.

It is undeniable that the arts and music have the power to evoke emotion, provide comfort, and bridge gaps between people with their messages of love and acceptance. Not only are they incredibly rich sources of inspiration and creativity, but the arts and music can also be used to make meaningful improvements to the quality of life.
 
 Firstly, exposure to the arts has been known to cultivate an appreciation of beauty and inspire creativity in those who experience them. This can be seen in the many paintings, sculptures, and other works of art that adorn galleries, churches, and public spaces. Music too can be a powerful source of inspiration, filling the listener with emotion, motivation, and a sense of hope. Listening to music can help one to learn about different cultures and recognise similarities between them, helping to bring people closer together.
 
 Secondly, the arts and music can have a profound effect on mental and physical health. Studies have shown that engaging with the arts can reduce anxiety and stress, while also boosting ones mood and overall sense of wellbeing. Music has an even greater impact, with research showing that it can improve cognitive function, reduce pain and fatigue, and even boost immune system functioning.
 
 Finally, the arts can be used to create social change. Artistic mediums like painting, theatre, and music can be used to raise awareness about important causes and spark positive social movements.

 In conclusion, it is clear that the arts and music can have a profound effect on the quality of life. It can help to foster creativity, reduce stress and anxiety, and even be used as a tool for social change. As such, it is essential that we make use of the power of the arts and music to improve the lives of those around us.";46;1401;1853;2112;1982.5
75;75;essay76.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/government-should-responsible-education-health-care-not-28777/;Government should be responsible for education and health care or not?;"Despite the development of modern society, the health care and education still remain the basic rights of citizens. And a much debated issue these days is whether or not the government should be responsible for citizens' health care and education.
 Some people argue that it is the government that should be obligated to fund the health care and education for citizens. This is because citizens enjoy the right to live in a harmonious and stable environment, which should be enabled by the government, the leader of the society. If citizens had no access to health care and education, their physical health and psychological soundness would be at risk. As a result, such people might fail to get cured in time, thus influencing their working efficiency, which would destabilize the production of the industry. Also, without sufficient guidance of teachers, these citizens might misbehave or even commit crimes, posing a threat to other citizens' security. Therefore, the government should be accountable for citizens' health care and education to keep society safe and stable.
 On the other hand, some people oppose the argument, saying it is a waste of public money for the government to subsidize health care and education of each citizen in society, since a great number of people, in fact, have had the capacity to pay for the both privately. Instead, the government should give priority to more pressing problems related to social members' wellbeing, such as soaring crime rate, AIDS epidemic or the shortage of infrastructure, which are requiring financial resources from the government to address.
 Personally, I think the government should fund the deprived for their health care and education, who are the group in real need for the authority's help. At the same time, citizens available for the both should encourage the government to allocate money to more urgent areas. After all, the harmonious society calls for the joint efforts of the government and citizens.
";"The debate over whether or not the government should be responsible for providing education and health care is one that has been ongoing for many years. On one hand, some argue that the government should be responsible for providing these services as it is their duty to ensure that citizens have access to the resources they need to live healthy and productive lives. On the other hand, some argue that the government should not be responsible for providing these services as it is not their job to do so and it would be too costly for taxpayers.
 
 In my opinion, I believe that the government should be responsible for providing education and health care. Education is essential for the development of a nation, and it is the governments responsibility to ensure that all citizens have access to quality education. Education is the foundation of a successful society, and without it, citizens would not be able to reach their full potential. Furthermore, health care is a basic human right, and it is the governments responsibility to ensure that all citizens have access to quality health care. Without access to health care, citizens would not be able to lead healthy and productive lives.
 
 In addition, providing education and health care is beneficial for the economy. Investing in education and health care can help to create jobs and stimulate economic growth. Furthermore, providing these services can help to reduce poverty and inequality, as citizens who have access to quality education and health care are more likely to be successful and productive members of society.
 
 Overall, I believe that the government should be responsible for providing education and health care. Education and health care are essential for the development of a nation, and it is the governments responsibility to ensure that all citizens have access to these services. Furthermore, providing these services can help to create jobs and stimulate economic growth, as well as reduce poverty and inequality.";"When considering whether or not the government should be responsible for education and health care, it is important to consider how government involvement in these two important fields can both benefit and potentially burden society. On one hand, the government has the ability to ensure access to quality education and health care for all its citizens. This would enable individuals to maximize their potential and lead healthier, more fulfilling lives. On the other hand, government involvement in these areas can also mean increased taxes and the potential for bureaucracy and inefficiency.
 
 Proponents of government involvement in education and health care point to the importance of ensuring quality education and health care for all individuals regardless of their socio-economic status. Many agree that education and health care are fundamental human rights that all people should be able to access regardless of their backgrounds. By providing funding for these services and establishing regulations and standards, the government can ensure that everyone has access to basic levels of education and health care. Furthermore, government involvement can also provide additional support to those in need, such as those with disabilities, who may require specialized services in order to have access to quality education and health care.
 
 On the other hand, opponents of government involvement in education and health care point to the potential burden it can place on society. Increased taxes can place a strain on individuals and businesses, while bureaucracy and inefficiency in the public sector can lead to slower service and increased costs. Additionally, there is a concern that government involvement could lead to a one-size-fits-all approach to education and health care that may not be able to address the needs of each individual.
 
 Ultimately, the decision of whether or not the government should be responsible for education and health care comes down to how much value society places on providing access to quality services for all citizens. If governments are able to structure systems in a way that ensures quality services for all and reduces inefficiencies, then government involvement may be beneficial. However, if governments are unable to provide quality services without burdening society, then it may be more prudent to rely on private solutions.";70;1976;1998;2380;2189.0
76;76;essay77.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/protect-animals-zoos-should-banned-29767/;zoos should be banned;"Children tend to visit zoos where various kinds of wild creatures could be seen. When it comes to whether zoos should exist on contemporary society, animal-right activists strongly recommended that wildlife belong to natural environment and zoos should be banned. I would not go along with their viewpoint as zoos have irreplaceable benefits in terms of animal preservation and children education.
 There is no denying that our environment is damaged day by day due to the fact that excessive pursuit of economic development at expense of eco-system, which pose a great threat to the survival of wild animals. In contrast, zoo is a good alternative choice for protecting animals as various animals could be better protected by specialized staff. Once the animal got sick, professional vet will help them promptly. Thanks to the considerate care, the diversity of wild animal could be guaranteed.
 Additionally, zoos afford a platform to education teenagers, helping to establish eco-friendly behavior towards animals. In the zoos, even though wild animals are caged, they have capability to walk in a limited area. When children pay a visit to the zoos, they still could observe the eating behavior or leisure activities among animals, which would definitely enrich their knowledge associated with different animals. Further, children could acquire the information regarding how to protect wild animals according to guided tour or volunteers.
 On the other hand, complained about the drawbacks of zoos are often heard. It is true that some zoos are lack of systematic management which attributes to numerous wild animals die because of food shortage. Also, being caged in the zoos for long render wildlife lost the ability to survive in nature where is full of cruel competition among various animals.
 In order to protect animals, from my perspective, zoos offer a good man-made environment which could prolong the life span of wild animals and cultivate the notion of protecting animals. What the zoos should do is improvement of the management system and use the income wisely in preserving wild animals better.
";"Zoos have been a part of human life for centuries, providing entertainment and education to millions of people. However, in recent years, there has been a growing debate about whether or not zoos should be banned. On one hand, zoos provide a safe environment for animals, and they can be educational and entertaining for visitors. On the other hand, zoos can be cruel and inhumane, and they can be detrimental to the health and wellbeing of the animals.
 
 The main argument for banning zoos is that they are cruel and inhumane. Animals in zoos are often kept in small, cramped enclosures, and they are deprived of their natural habitats and the opportunity to engage in natural behaviors. This can lead to physical and psychological problems, such as depression, anxiety, and aggression. Furthermore, animals in zoos are often subjected to unnatural breeding practices, which can lead to genetic abnormalities and health problems.
 
 Another argument for banning zoos is that they are detrimental to the health and wellbeing of the animals. Animals in zoos are often exposed to unnatural diets, and they can suffer from malnutrition and other health problems. Furthermore, animals in zoos are often subjected to unnatural breeding practices, which can lead to genetic abnormalities and health problems. Finally, animals in zoos are often exposed to stressors, such as loud noises and large crowds, which can lead to physical and psychological problems.
 
 In conclusion, zoos should be banned because they are cruel and inhumane, and they can be detrimental to the health and wellbeing of the animals. Zoos do not provide a natural environment for animals, and they can lead to physical and psychological problems. Furthermore, zoos can be detrimental to the health and wellbeing of the animals, as they are often exposed to unnatural diets, breeding practices, and stressors. For these reasons, zoos should be banned.";"Zoos have long been used for entertainment, scientific research, and natural conservation. However, with the emergence of the animal rights movement, there is an ever growing debate surrounding the ethical implications of keeping animals in captivity for these purposes. This essay will argue that zoos should be banned because they are detrimental to animal welfare, limit educational opportunities, and offer limited conservation benefits.
 
 Zoos are often criticized for their detrimental impact on animal welfare. Animals in zoos are often cramped in small enclosures and deprived of their natural habitats and behaviors, leading to increased levels of stress and anxiety. They are also susceptible to serious health problems such as arthritis, obesity, and claustrophobia due to their lack of physical and mental stimulation. It is also argued that the living conditions in zoos are generally not suitable for animals, leading to an overall decrease in their quality of life. 
 
 Furthermore, zoos limit educational opportunities by providing an artificial environment in which to observe and learn about animals. While zoos may teach visitors basic facts about certain animals, they do not provide a thorough understanding of animal behavior and ecology. For example, visitors may learn that polar bears like to swim, but they will not learn about the complex social and hunting behaviors unique to polar bears in the wild. 
 
 Finally, zoos provide limited conservation benefits due to their lack of funding and resources. Although some zoos participate in conservation programs, most animals in captivity do not contribute to conservation efforts and are rarely released into their natural habitats. Furthermore, the money spent on maintaining captive animals could be redirected to more effective conservation initiatives, such as habitat protection and species recovery programs.
 
 In conclusion, zoos should be banned because they are detrimental to animal welfare, limit educational opportunities, and offer limited conservation benefits. Keeping animals in captivity for these purposes is ethically wrong and should no longer be tolerated. We must instead focus our resources on more effective conservation initiatives that truly benefit wildlife and their habitats.";21;2115;1919;2281;2100.0
77;77;essay78.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/economic-development-vs-environment-29747/;economic development vs environment;"Currently, a great number of countries have pushed forward their economies by developing national industries. However, some people are worried that the economic targets in industrialized countries may be attained at the expense of the ecosystems. From my perspective, I think flourishing economies can go hand in hand with environmental preservation.
 Admittedly, some countries may place economic developments ahead of environmental protection, thus ruining the local environments. As these needy countries lack adequate financial and human resources, advanced technologies and experience, they have to rely on natural resources to maintain their living standards. Besides, people in the poverty-stricken areas are not likely to be equipped with knowledge to preserve the ecosystems. As a result, unchecked and reckless uses of the local raw materials may happen, which can put a strain on the natural resources. In this view, the economic development and environmental protection can be conflicting.
 However, I believe the booming economy can be closely linked to the preservation of the environment. With people raising their awareness of the green economy, the products free of pollutants are increasingly prevalent among clients, which means eco-friendly businesses can make a favourable impression on customers today, triggering sales. For example, electronic bicycles powered by clean energy resources have been well received among people in recent years.
 Furthermore, taking environmental consequences seriously can enhance working efficiencies. If a firm is environmentally conscious, it may have to make optimal use of its resources to improve its production lines and equipment, which can boost productivity. Therefore, it may spur its economic development. On the other hand, without the requirement of environmental preservation, the firm would still consume a vast amount of energy which constitutes a large part of its operational costs, being a hurdle to the economic develpment.
 Therefore, I would conclude that thriving economies and the preservation of ecosystems can be promoted simultaneously. On the other hand, I suppose the developed countries should support the underdeveloped areas by providing financial resources, technologies and experience so that the environmental problems can be effectively alleviated in these areas.
";"The debate between economic development and environmental protection has been ongoing for decades. On one side, economic development is seen as essential for the growth and prosperity of a nation, while on the other, environmental protection is seen as essential for the preservation of the planet. Both sides of the debate have valid points, and it is important to consider both when making decisions about the future of a nation.
 
 Economic development is the process of increasing the wealth of a nation through the production of goods and services. This is usually done through the use of natural resources, such as land, water, and minerals. Economic development can bring about increased employment, higher wages, and improved standards of living. It can also lead to increased investment, which can lead to further economic growth.
 
 Environmental protection is the process of protecting the environment from the effects of human activities. This includes reducing pollution, conserving natural resources, and protecting wildlife. Environmental protection is essential for the preservation of the planet and its resources. It is also important for the health and well-being of humans, as it can reduce the risk of disease and other health problems.
 
 The debate between economic development and environmental protection is complex and difficult to resolve. On one hand, economic development is necessary for the growth and prosperity of a nation, while on the other, environmental protection is essential for the preservation of the planet. It is important to consider both sides of the debate when making decisions about the future of a nation.
 
 The best way to approach this debate is to find a balance between economic development and environmental protection. This can be done by investing in renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, and by implementing policies that promote sustainable development. This will ensure that economic growth is not achieved at the expense of the environment, and that the planet is protected for future generations.";"The debate between economic development and environmental protection is one that has spanned centuries. On one hand, economic development brings the potential for improved living standards and economic growth. On the other hand, environmental protection requires that societies must find the balance between economic growth and environmental sustainability. 
 
 In the past, economics and environment have been seen as contradictory and mutually exclusive. In the present, however, the two should be seen as interdependent and mutually reinforcing.
 
 The main concept behind economic development is that of creating wealth and security, generally through capital investment, increased productivity and encouraged trade. Economic development is an essential component of a nations overall success, and the socio-economic security it provides helps to ensure the well-being of citizens.
 
 At the same time, environmental protection seeks to improve the quality of life and reduce the degradation of the environment. Environmental protection has been highlighted recently as a major issue in both developed and developing countries. This is in part due to the effects of climate change, pollution, deforestation and soil erosion, as well as the increasing effects of natural disasters.
 
 Despite the importance of economic development, it should be noted that this development should take place in a sustainable manner. To achieve this, economic development must be included in any environmental policy. Governments should promote green policies that encourage the efficient use of natural resources, foster technological innovation and promote the use of renewable energy sources.
 
 It is clear that economic development and environmental protection are two sides of the same coin. However, the two should not be seen as competing interests. Rather, they should be viewed as complementary parts of a larger system. By working together, governments and businesses can promote economic growth while protecting the environment. We must take into account the long-term consequences of our actions and develop strategies to ensure a better future. Only then can we truly achieve sustainable economic development that safeguards the environment.";35;2354;2077;2241;2159.0
78;78;essay79.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/government-should-spend-money-arts-not-only-public-services-29746/;Government should spend money on ARTs, not only on public services;"As people have raised their democratic awareness in recent years, they are caring more about how the tax expenditure is distributed by the government. As a result, some people suggest that the tax money should be allocated to publically beneficial services instead of arts. However, from my perspective, I think arts are supposed to be included in the government's investment as well.
 Admittedly, the government should give priority to public services and facilities. This is because the government plays the role of a leader among citizens, which should discharge the responsibility of making optimal use of the tax money to keep society safe and stable. Simultaneously, public services such as education system or medical care can meet people's basic demand of survival, security and knowledge, thus making them feel comfortable, which can lower the crime rate. Therefore, public services and facilities should be given adequate attention by the authorities to maintain social stability.
 On the other hand, I believe arts should by no means been disregarded by the government. Individually, arts can enrich people's cultural lives. Currently, people are increasingly occupied with their work and studies due to the stiff competition. Consequently, they require various entertainment such as music, movies or books to them ease their minds and release pressure. Without arts, people would be at risk of suffering psychological problems.
 From the point of the local community, funding arts is beneficial to the local cultural and economic development. Cultural heritage constitutes an essential part of arts. This means preserving local arts may promote the preservation of the local cultural heritage, which not only helps the local people have a sense of belonging but also contributes to the booming local tourism industry. In this view, arts serve cultural and economic purposes .
 With those arguments in mind, I would conclude that public services and facilities are an integral part of the government expenditure. At the same time, the authorities should also respect the value of arts which are individually and socially advantageous.
";"The debate over how government funds should be allocated is a long-standing one, and it is often argued that public services should be prioritized over arts funding. However, this argument fails to recognize the important role that the arts play in society. Arts funding is an investment in the future of our society, and it should be given equal consideration when it comes to government spending.
 
 The arts are an integral part of our culture, and they provide a platform for creativity and expression. They can also be used to educate and inspire people, and to foster a sense of community. Arts funding allows for the creation of art that can be enjoyed by everyone, and it can help to promote understanding and appreciation of different cultures. Furthermore, the arts can be used to bring people together and to create a sense of unity.
 
 In addition to the cultural benefits of arts funding, there are also economic benefits. The arts are a major source of employment, and they contribute significantly to the economy. Arts funding can help to create jobs and to stimulate economic growth. Furthermore, the arts can attract tourists and generate revenue for local businesses.
 
 Finally, arts funding can help to improve public services. Arts funding can be used to fund programs that provide educational and recreational opportunities for children and adults. These programs can help to reduce crime and improve public health. Furthermore, arts funding can be used to fund projects that help to improve infrastructure, such as public transportation and parks.
 
 In conclusion, arts funding should be given equal consideration when it comes to government spending. The arts are an integral part of our culture, and they provide a platform for creativity and expression. They can also be used to educate and inspire people, and to foster a sense of community. Furthermore, the arts can be used to create jobs and to stimulate economic growth. Finally, arts funding can help to improve public services by providing educational and recreational opportunities for children and adults. For these reasons, government should spend money on arts, not only on public services.";"In the modern age, government budgets are often allocated to ensure public services, such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure. However, studies have shown that investing in the Arts can provide a much-needed creative release and contribute greatly to a healthy society. Therefore, it should be the responsibility of the government to invest and promote the Arts, in addition to providing essential public services.
 
 The Arts provide an outlet for creative expression that allows individuals to express themselves in various forms, such as painting, literature, music, and theatre. This encourages engagement, development, and a feeling of inclusion within the community. Having access to the Arts provides an outlet for stress, helping to reduce mental health issues within the population. The Arts also have a role to play in the physical health of citizens, as active participation in the Arts increases physical fitness and performance. Furthermore, studies suggest that frequent engagement in any activity reduces the risk of developing Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia.
 
 The Arts also play an important role in the development and education of children and young adults, helping to foster both creativity and imagination. In todays digital age, it is more important than ever to have a strong imaginative capacity and to be able to express oneself in new and creative ways. The Arts provide endless learning opportunities and stimulate engagement in core subjects, such as mathematics and history, helping to create a rounded education for all students.
 
 In addition to the educational benefits of Arts promotion, the Arts also provide an economic advantage. Supporting the Arts encourages private investment, as well as job creation, allowing for increased tax revenue. Investing in the Arts contributes to sustainable tourism, as individuals are drawn in by the range of cultural experiences offered by the Arts. This in turn provides an increase in employment opportunities, with more jobs available in production, performance, and marketing sectors.
 
 Overall, investing in the Arts is an important and beneficial move for the government to make. The Arts provide an outlet for creativity, educational and economic advantages, as well as health benefits. By investing and promoting the Arts, the government can ensure that citizens are provided with a creative outlet, increased educational opportunities, and greater employment potential. In doing so, the government can ensure that every individual is able to reach their full potential, and that society is healthy and thriving.";66;2146;2178;2613;2395.5
79;79;essay80.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/keeping-animals-zoos-right-wrong-29620/;Keeping animals in zoos;"Since the time they were introduced zoos have both been supported and criticized. Many believe that zoos could be very entertaining and ecologically important, whereas, others think that keeping animals in captivity is totally wrong. Both sides will be discussed before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.
 First, critics of zoology argue that keeping animals in captivity is wrong because animals should be considered non-human persons and they should have the right of having freedom. This is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures. That is because, many zoos, especially the ones in developing countries, do not provide care and attention which their animals require. The animals are often undernourished and do not have sufficient quality and quantity of medical treatment. In addition, sometimes animals from hot countries have to survive in the cold winter of somewhere in Europe.
 On the other hand, the advocators believe that zoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology. Many people, especially young children enjoy going to zoos and see their favorite animals, cute baby-born animals and the animals that are from the different corners of the world. Zoos provide educational information about the lives of different animals to the public. Also, zoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life. This is due to the fact that, in zoos, animals are kept in enclosures which simulate their own habitats and also endangered animals are being protected from their predators or hunters. Thus zoos are needed to keep the nature balanced.
 In conclusion, both of the arguments have strong supports, but in my own view, more good come from zoos than bad. However, it is hoped that the standards of zoos should be leveled up to ensure that the animals in zoos are provided with good care and attention.
";"Animals have been kept in zoos for centuries, and the practice is still a controversial topic today. On one hand, zoos provide a safe and secure environment for animals, and can be a great educational tool for people to learn about different species. On the other hand, some people argue that keeping animals in captivity is cruel and unnatural, and that zoos are not able to provide the same quality of life that animals would have in the wild.
 
 The primary argument in favor of keeping animals in zoos is that it provides a safe and secure environment for them. Zoos are able to provide food, shelter, and medical care for animals, and can protect them from predators and other dangers. In addition, zoos can be a great educational tool for people to learn about different species and their habitats. Zoos can also help to conserve endangered species, as they can provide a safe place for breeding and raising young animals.
 
 However, there are also arguments against keeping animals in zoos. One of the main criticisms is that zoos are not able to provide the same quality of life that animals would have in the wild. Animals in zoos are often confined to small enclosures, and may not have enough space to roam and explore. In addition, they may not have access to the same variety of food that they would have in the wild, and may not be able to engage in natural behaviors such as hunting or foraging.
 
 Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to keep animals in zoos is a complex one, and there is no single right answer. While zoos can provide a safe and secure environment for animals, and can be a great educational tool for people, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks of keeping animals in captivity. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide if the benefits of keeping animals in zoos outweigh the potential drawbacks.";"The debate about keeping animals in zoos is one that has been ongoing for many years. One of the main arguments for keeping animals in zoos is that it provides a safe and secure environment for them to live, where they can be monitored and studied. This has led many to believe that it is a better system than allowing them to live in their natural habitats, where they can be subject to the dangers of predators, nature, and human interference. On the other hand, there are those who feel that keeping animals in captivity is cruel and inhumane. It is important to consider both sides of the debate to come to an informed decision.
 
 The main argument for keeping animals in zoos is that it provides a safe and secure environment for them. Zoos have teams of experts and veterinarians that work to monitor the health and safety of the animals, and are able to respond quickly if there are any changes in an animals behavior or health. Additionally, zoos are able to provide food and shelter for animals that might not otherwise have access to these things in their natural habitats. Furthermore, zoos are used as a way to educate the public on conservation and animal welfare, giving people an opportunity to see first-hand the importance of preserving nature and the diversity of life on Earth.
 
 However, the other side of the debate points to the inhumane nature of keeping animals in captivity. Animals are deprived of their right to roam free and explore their natural habitats, limited instead to the confines of a cage or enclosure. Additionally, they often experience distress due to being separated from their natural environment, as well as the other animals they would normally interact with. This can lead to boredom, depression, and even aggression, which are all issues that these animals should not have to experience.
 
 Overall, when it comes to the debate concerning keeping animals in zoos, it is important to consider both sides of the argument. While keeping animals in zoos does provide them with a safe and secure environment, the other side of the argument points to the inhumane nature of doing so. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide their stance on the matter.";23;1978;1862;2204;2033.0
80;80;essay81.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/essay-freedom-express-ideas-29565/;Artists' freedom to express ideas;"Artists in most countries are given the freedom to express their thoughts in whatever they do. Nevertheless, some argue that there should be government restrictions in order to limit their opinions. I however, agree to this only to a certain extent and believe that the artists must be given freedom so that they will produce some really marvelous masterpiece.
 First and foremost, if there is control over artists' ideas, they will definitely lose their sense of creativity in the long run. It is undeniable that when they are given the opportunity to express themselves, most artists will think out of the box and come up with spectacular Arts such as paintings or movies. For example, paintings by Da Vinci and Michallengo are admired even till now as they were not restricted during those times. In short, without any limitations, there will be more awe inspiring work from our artists.
 Furthermore, it is every human's right to be able to voice out their opinions in any ways as long as they do not cause any problems to the nation. Today, many countries make numerous efforts to show that they are democratic countries. Arts is one of the ways that can be used to criticise social problems and government policies in a particular country. To illustrate this further, the famous movie '3 Idiots' acted by Amir Khan criticises the education system which is chiefly based on memorising and not being able to apply whatever the students learn. Thus, human rights is violated if artists are not allowed to express their feelings freely.
 Looking from another perspective, there are certain drawbacks if artists are not restricted. They might go deeper into certain aspects that can cause controversies in a country. To cite an example, Malaysia is a multiracial country whereby all the citizens live together in harmony and peace. In case there is anyone who brings up some sensitive issues in their films or books regarding any races, this might end up in some chaos among the society. Nonetheless, I believe that artists know their boundaries very well and would surely do not want their names tarnished just because of their unscrupulous acts.
 To conclude, it is now evident that there should not be any restrictions on artists' work. Allowing them to think freely will give them an opportunity to express themselves as ideas can naturally flow when there are no limitations. Hence, even though freedom to express ideas can bring some negative effects, I certainly believe that there are many wonderful and beautiful Arts due to the freedom to express ideas and thus, I strongly believe there should be no restrictions on them.
";"Artists have long been seen as the voice of the people, a way to express ideas and feelings that cannot be expressed in any other way. This is why freedom of expression is so important for artists. It allows them to express their ideas, feelings, and opinions without fear of censorship or retribution.
 
 Freedom of expression is a fundamental human right, and it is essential for artists to be able to express themselves without fear of censorship or retribution. Without this freedom, artists would be unable to create works that are meaningful and thought-provoking. They would be unable to challenge the status quo or to bring attention to important issues.
 
 The right to freedom of expression is not only important for artists, but for everyone. It allows us to express our opinions and beliefs without fear of censorship or retribution. It allows us to challenge the status quo and to bring attention to important issues. It allows us to create works of art that are meaningful and thought-provoking.
 
 Unfortunately, freedom of expression is not always respected. In some countries, artists are censored or even punished for expressing their ideas. This is why it is so important for us to stand up for the right to freedom of expression. We must ensure that artists are able to express themselves without fear of censorship or retribution.
 
 In conclusion, freedom of expression is essential for artists. It allows them to express their ideas, feelings, and opinions without fear of censorship or retribution. It allows us to challenge the status quo and to bring attention to important issues. We must ensure that artists are able to express themselves without fear of censorship or retribution.";"Artists have a right to express their ideas and opinions freely, regardless of the opinions of others. In a democratic society, this right should be respected and protected.
 
 The right to free expression is a cornerstone of a democratic society and essential in a free and open society. It allows people to participate in the political process and express their opinion. Without the right to express their ideas, artists could not freely create and share their artistic works with an audience.
 
 Artists are creative individuals, and their creative works often reflect and portray ideas that are controversial or unpopular. Society should accept, embrace and protect their right to express these ideas, because diversity of opinion and perspective encourages critical thinking, which is necessary for the progress of human civilization.
 
 Art can also be a platform for social and political commentary. It can help to bring to light issues that may have been ignored or overlooked by the mainstream media or public opinion. It allows for the expression of alternative views and encourages the exploration of alternative solutions to social and political issues.
 
 The right to free expression can also be a source of entertainment. By allowing artists to freely express their ideas, society can experience diverse and unique forms of entertainment. This can also lead to greater awareness and appreciation of different cultures and art forms, which can be beneficial to the understanding of our world.
 
 However, the right to free expression must be balanced with other rights, such as the right not to be offended. Society must be willing to accept and respect the opinions of others, even if those opinions are different from our own.
 
 Ultimately, freedom of expression is a fundamental right and an essential part of any democratic society. Whether we agree or disagree with an artists viewpoint, it is important to respect and protect their right to express their ideas freely.";33;2634;1709;1989;1849.0
81;81;essay82.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/advertising-positive-negative-part-lives-29467/;Advertising - positive or negative part of our lives;"Nowadays, the use of advertisement through different forms of media such as newspapers, radio and television has become very prevalent, so it is thought to be a necessary part of today's society. Many believe that advertising has brought great benefits to lives therefore it should be considered a positive activity while others have held a complete different idea about this. Both views will be critiqued before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.
 First, it is generally understood that advertising is carried out with the main purpose of promoting different products and services or encouraging people to consume more. Advertisements are, therefore, very important for many businesses to increase sales and hence profits. Also, to consumers, advertising can bring them many benefits. For example, customers of telecommunication services will have an idea about the current offers of different companies and hence they can compare them and then have a better decision in choosing their internet or mobile phone plans. From all of these, it is easy to see why the idea that advertising is a positive part of life will garner strong support.
 However, it can be seen that some people have argued against advertising due to its negative impacts. Firstly, a huge amount of different advertisements could be sent automatically by a system to personal phones or email addresses, this is generally known as spam, and causes discomfort or even annoyance to many people. Secondly, advertising can be very expensive and not every advertising campaign can be done successfully and brings good results. Therefore, advertising is believed by many, a financial burden to businesses.
 In conclusion, after analyzing the pros and cons of advertising, both of the views have strong support, but it is felt that more good comes from advertising than bad. Thus, the idea that advertising is a positive part of life can be more supported.
";"Advertising is a pervasive part of our lives, and it has both positive and negative effects. On the one hand, advertising can be seen as a positive force in our lives, providing us with information about products and services that we may not have otherwise known about. It can also be seen as a way to promote economic growth, as it encourages people to buy products and services, thus stimulating the economy. On the other hand, advertising can be seen as a negative force in our lives, as it can be used to manipulate people into buying things they dont need, or to promote unhealthy lifestyles.
 
 The positive effects of advertising are undeniable. Advertising can provide us with information about products and services that we may not have otherwise known about. It can also be used to promote economic growth, as it encourages people to buy products and services, thus stimulating the economy. Advertising can also be used to promote social causes, such as environmental protection and animal rights. Finally, advertising can be used to spread awareness about important issues, such as health and safety.
 
 However, advertising can also be seen as a negative force in our lives. It can be used to manipulate people into buying things they dont need, or to promote unhealthy lifestyles. Advertising can also be used to spread false information, or to promote products and services that are not in the best interest of the consumer. Finally, advertising can be used to exploit vulnerable populations, such as children and the elderly.
 
 In conclusion, advertising can be seen as both a positive and a negative force in our lives. While it can be used to provide us with information about products and services, it can also be used to manipulate people into buying things they dont need, or to promote unhealthy lifestyles. It is important to be aware of the potential negative effects of advertising, and to be mindful of how it is used in our lives.";"Advertising has become an ever-present part of our daily lives. Everywhere we look, we are swamped with colorful ads of companies vying for our attention and purchase. Its influence is undeniable and its controversy is hard to ignore. Is advertising a positive or negative part of our lives?
 
 Advertising has some undeniable benefits. It brings attention to products and services which might otherwise go unnoticed, allowing companies to find their target markets. Furthermore, advertising allows for more competition in the marketplace, as companies need to work harder to differentiate themselves and offer better value to their potential customers. These efforts bring about more innovation, encouraging companies to create better products and services that better meet the needs of their customers.
 
 On the other hand, advertising can have a negative influence on us as individuals. For example, the constant bombardment of ads can encourage us to buy products and services which we dont really need or can barely afford. Additionally, the relentlessness of advertising can make us feel inadequate, as were constantly being bombarded with images of perfection, leading us to compare ourselves with unrealistic standards.
 
 Overall, advertising can be a positive part of our lives, providing us with a wealth of information and giving companies the opportunity to compete in the marketplace. However, we must also be aware of the potential negative consequences of advertising, and do our best to remain informed and make the best decisions for ourselves and our families.";52;1919;1957;1580;1768.5
82;82;essay83.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/the-nuclear-power-provide-clean-cheap-energy-29457/;The nuclear power provide clean and cheap energy;"The topic of nuclear technology frequently generates a heated debate with proponenets maintaining that nuclear power provides a source of efficient and economical energy while opponents argue that atomic technology is uncontrollable and very dangerous to handle. As far as my opinion is concerned , I find myself aligned with opponenets of the usages of nuclear power. I have several reasons to believe its disadvantages outnumber the few advantages.
 First and foremost reason is that pursuit of nuclear technology one way or the other leads towards atomic weapons. Last centuary has witnesed the horrors of such weapons. If each country pursues the fusion and fission process some of them may try to mold it for millitary usage.
 Another reason to fortify my opinion is that even civil usages of atomic power pose a dire threat of radio activity. For example recently there has been an incident in which an atomic power house leaked tons of radio active material into air when an earthquake hit the surrounding area. This unfortunate event proves that no matter how much careful we are such accidents are unevitable.
 Last but not least, while generating energy from any source be it hydro power or oil there always is some wastage and so is the case with nuclear power. Safely getting rid of nuclear waste is a daunting task and there has not been any permanat solution of it. This waste is many times more lethal to our environment than any of the other hazordous material.
 To sum it up, from above mentioned facts it can easily be deduced that nuclear power may apear silver bullet for energy crisis but its disadvantages far outweigh the adavantages. Thus i suggest that use of nuclear technology should be discouraged even for civil purposes.
";"Nuclear power is a clean and cheap source of energy that has been used to generate electricity for decades. It is a reliable and efficient form of energy that has been proven to be safe and cost-effective. Nuclear power plants produce electricity by using the heat generated from a nuclear reaction to turn water into steam, which then powers a turbine. This process does not produce any greenhouse gases, making it a clean form of energy.
 
 Nuclear power is also a very cost-effective form of energy. Nuclear plants are expensive to build, but once they are up and running, they are relatively inexpensive to operate. This is because the fuel used in nuclear plants is uranium, which is abundant and relatively cheap. Additionally, nuclear plants have a long lifespan, meaning that the cost of electricity produced by nuclear plants is spread out over a long period of time.
 
 Nuclear power is also a reliable form of energy. Nuclear plants are designed to operate continuously and are not affected by weather or other external factors. This means that nuclear power plants can provide a steady and reliable source of electricity, even during times of peak demand. Additionally, nuclear plants are designed to be safe and secure, with multiple safety systems in place to prevent accidents.
 
 In conclusion, nuclear power is a clean, cheap, and reliable source of energy. It is a safe and cost-effective form of energy that can provide a steady and reliable source of electricity. Nuclear power is an important part of the global energy mix and will continue to be an important source of electricity for many years to come.";"In the 21st century, our world has had to face the stark reality of depleting resources, dangerous emissions, and a fragile environment. With limited options, the world has looked towards one of the oldest sources of power, nuclear energy. This form of power has provided humanity with clean and cheap energy that can help put an end to its dependence on limited resources and help create clean energy for the future.
 
 Nuclear power provides an efficient and sustainable source of energy. By using the process of fission, a large amount of energy can be generated by splitting the atoms of uranium, a process that requires a fraction of the resources and produces minimal pollution. This makes the release of tiny amounts of carbon dioxide into the air and causes negligible damage to the environment. Moreover, nuclear energy production uses less land than other traditional energy sources such as coal and oil. This allows more land to be used for other things such as agricultural growth, or housing and transportation projects.
 
 The cost benefit ratio of nuclear energy is also high. By using nuclear energy, the cost of energy production is much lower than traditional sources. This provides an inexpensive source of energy that can meet the needs of a growing population. As more plants are built and technology is developed, the cost of energy production can be reduced even further. This makes nuclear energy a great choice for countries that are looking for an efficient, cost-effective alternative to traditional energy sources.
 
 In addition to providing clean and cheap energy, nuclear power also offers a level of safety and security that is hard to find with other sources of energy. The advanced safety systems in nuclear plants have made it possible to contain and control the release of radiation. As technology continues to improve, the safety of these plants is further ensured and the risk of radiation release is minimized. The risk of accidental or terrorist attacks on nuclear plants is also minimized due to the tight security protocols in place.
 
 The nuclear power provide clean and cheap energy is a great solution to the energy needs of the world. It has the potential to replace the use of traditional energy sources and reduce the risk of climate change. With advancements in safety protocols and technology, nuclear energy is a reliable and low-cost alternative to traditional energy sources. By utilizing the power of nuclear energy, humanity can build a more sustainable and secure energy future.";48;1751;1626;2535;2080.5
83;83;essay84.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/giving-mobile-phones-unemployed-essay-29393/;Giving mobile phones to the unemployed;"Today, the rate of unemployment is on the rise and is seriously being debated by many. Some opine that the best method to minimize this problem is by providing the unemployed with hand phones that have access to the Internet. They also believe that this solution is the most appropriate way to utilize the public money. Nevertheless, I agree to this solution only to a certain degree because I feel that giving those with no work a mobile phone each is a total waste of money.
 In a positive point of view, when people without jobs have hand phones that have access to the Internet, they will be able to browse the net for more job opportunities. For example, they can surf the The Star Onlines' work section to find a job that is suitable for them. With the help of the net, they can also do more research on the work that they have found apart from looking up on how they can prepare themselves for the job. Not only that, the mobile phones can also be used to make calls with the companies in which they would like to work with. In short, if the government provides those without work with a mobile phone, they will be able to find themselves an occupation in order to live and survive.
 Nonetheless, looking from another perspective, supplying hand phones to the unemployed is a waste of the taxpayers' money. This is because the money instead of being used to supply the electronic gadget can be used for other useful purposes for the country. To illustrate this further, the money can be used to build more amenities for the public or given to the poor so that they can use it to help them earn a living. To conclude, the money can be used for other intentions rather than giving hand phones to the unemployed.
 Furthermore, when hand phones are provided for free, many would want to take advantage of this opportunity. It will not be surprising that in order to obtain a mobile phone, they make themselves jobless. Some might even go to the extent of lying that they are on unemployment to make them eligible to get the phones. In this context, the public's money is spent worthlessly. On top of that, till now, there are no surveys or evidences that prove this method in effective in reducing the rate of unemployment.
 To put it in a nutshell, the suggestion of providing those who are jobless with mobile phones that are accessible to internet is not a proper and the best way to trim down the rate of unemployment. I suggest the government look into the background of the people in depth before giving out hand phones to them. I strongly believe that the public money should be utilized for the benefit of the society and not just for some of them who are not willing to put in more effort to find them a proper work.
";"The issue of giving mobile phones to the unemployed is a complex one, and one that has been debated for many years. On one hand, providing mobile phones to the unemployed could be seen as a way to help them stay connected to potential employers and job opportunities. On the other hand, there are concerns that this could be seen as a form of welfare, and that it could lead to people relying on government assistance instead of actively seeking employment.
 
 The primary argument in favor of giving mobile phones to the unemployed is that it would provide them with a tool to help them find employment. Mobile phones are a powerful tool for communication, and they can be used to search for job postings, apply for jobs, and stay in touch with potential employers. Additionally, mobile phones can be used to access online job training and other resources that can help people find employment. This could be especially beneficial for those who live in rural areas, where access to job resources may be limited.
 
 However, there are also some valid concerns about giving mobile phones to the unemployed. For one, there is the potential for people to become dependent on government assistance. If people are given a mobile phone, they may become less motivated to actively seek employment, as they may feel that they have all the resources they need to find a job. Additionally, there is the potential for people to misuse the phones, using them for activities such as gambling or other activities that could be detrimental to their financial situation.
 
 Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to give mobile phones to the unemployed should be made on a case-by-case basis. For those who live in rural areas and have limited access to job resources, providing a mobile phone could be a great way to help them find employment. However, for those who live in more urban areas, it may be better to focus on providing job training and other resources that can help them find employment. Additionally, it is important to ensure that those who are given mobile phones are using them responsibly and not relying on government assistance.";"The rising cost of living and the stagnation of wages has left many people without jobs feeling the financial pinch. Mobile phones can provide a valuable lifeline for the unemployed, allowing them to keep in touch with potential employers and to access valuable resources such as job advice websites. This essay will discuss the merits of giving mobile phones to the unemployed and some of the practical measures needed to make such a scheme successful.
 
 The first argument in favour of giving mobile phones to the unemployed is that it could help reduce the cost of job searching. Many people without a job and a fixed income struggle to keep up with the cost of applying for jobs; travel expenses for interviews and the cost of printing CVs can add up quickly. A mobile phone could allow jobseekers to apply for and attend interviews without having to incur these costs. Mobile phones also allow jobseekers to keep up to date in the job market by receiving notifications of relevant job postings and staying in touch with potential employers. In an increasingly digital world, having a mobile phone could give the unemployed a much-needed edge and increase their chances of finding meaningful employment.
 
 Providing mobile phones to the unemployed is not a cost-free solution, however. Such a scheme would require substantial funding to cover the cost of the phones, and potentially also the monthly bill associated with them. Therefore, it is essential for any scheme to have a clear budget and target audience in order to ensure it is cost-effective. The scheme would also need to be tightly regulated so that applicants satisfy the criteria, such as proving they are actively seeking employment. Furthermore, the scheme must ensure the safety and privacy of the users, and that the phones are only used for accepted purposes such as job searching.
 
 In conclusion, giving mobile phones to the unemployed could be a cost-effective way to help people in need stay connected with potential employers and job opportunities. To ensure the scheme's success, a clear budget and target audience must be established, and it must be tightly regulated to ensure users are able to safely use the phones for job-related activities. Such a scheme could potentially be a lifeline for those who are struggling to find employment and might otherwise be left behind in an increasingly digital world.";38;2729;2136;2391;2263.5
84;84;essay85.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/use-cctv-cameras-essay-29373/;Use of CCTV cameras;"Today, close circuit television (CCTV) cameras are widely used in a variety of circumstances. They are used in schools, businesses and some other premises in order to monitor the activities taking place. It is undeniable that the use of CCTV has plenty of benefits to offer, especially in reducing crimes and protecting the employees in a premise. Nevertheless, some argue that these cameras invade their privacies due to constantly being monitored. Even so, I strongly believe that CCTV cameras should be installed in every premise to combat the ever increasing theft rate and to protect the workers at the workplace.
 Firstly, by having CCTV cameras at workplace, crimes such as robbery can be trimmed down. This is because when a shop is attacked by thieves, the clips taken by these cameras serve as a source of evidence to help the thieves to be traced. To illustrate this further, in Malaysia, policemen used the videos captured by the CCTV cameras to trace and successfully catch a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop during the midnight. Not only that, as the employees know that they are under constant surveillance, they will less likely steal from the shops. Thus, it is clear that CCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized.
 Furthermore, at some offices, employees are often required to handle angry or frustrated customers. At times, face-to-face interactions with an annoyed customer can put the employee in physical danger. Hence, the installation of CCTV cameras may help the employees escape this situation because the customers know very well that their conversations are recorded. In the event of an argument, the videotapes can used to determine what actually took place and further actions can be then taken. In short, these cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers.
 Looking from another perspective, the use of CCTV cameras does cause controversy. Those opposing the CCTV systems feel that their privacies are invaded with the constant monitoring of the cameras. However, one must realize that safety is of paramount importance compared to privacy and prevention is always better than suffering from the consequences. Ergo, opponents of this system should try to comprehend the situation and take actions to prevent themselves from being victims of crime.
 To conclude, CCTV cameras are essential and therefore must be installed in every premise. This is chiefly to shield oneself from being harmed by any intruders or robbers. Admittedly, privacies are lost with the use of these cameras. Nonetheless, safety should be put first in order to be safe.
";"The use of CCTV cameras has become increasingly popular in recent years, as they are seen as a way to deter crime and increase public safety. CCTV cameras are used in a variety of settings, such as public areas, businesses, and even in some residential homes. While the use of CCTV cameras can be beneficial in certain situations, there are also some potential drawbacks that should be considered.
 
 One of the primary benefits of CCTV cameras is that they can help to deter crime. By having cameras in public areas, criminals may be less likely to commit a crime, as they know that they are being watched. This can help to reduce the amount of crime in an area, as criminals may be less likely to take the risk of being caught. Additionally, CCTV cameras can help to provide evidence in the event of a crime, as they can provide a record of what happened. This can be especially helpful in cases where there are no witnesses or other forms of evidence.
 
 However, there are also some potential drawbacks to the use of CCTV cameras. One of the main concerns is that they can be intrusive, as they can be used to monitor peoples activities without their knowledge or consent. This can be especially concerning in areas where people may have a reasonable expectation of privacy, such as in their own homes. Additionally, there is the potential for abuse of the technology, as it can be used to target certain individuals or groups.
 
 Overall, the use of CCTV cameras can be beneficial in certain situations, as they can help to deter crime and provide evidence in the event of a crime. However, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks of the technology, as it can be intrusive and open to abuse. Therefore, it is important to weigh the pros and cons of using CCTV cameras before deciding to install them.";"The use of CCTV cameras, or closed-circuit television cameras, is becoming increasingly commonplace in both public and private locations. These devices allow people to monitor the comings and goings of other people in a given location without their permission or even knowledge. In recent years, the question of whether or not CCTV cameras are beneficial to society has been hotly debated. There are many who believe that the use of CCTV cameras is beneficial to society, while others feel that they violate basic rights.
 
 Supporters of CCTV cameras often point to the fact that they can provide valuable evidence of criminal activity. For example, if a store is broken into or a crime is committed in a public place, CCTV cameras can be used to provide an enhanced level of evidence for law enforcement to use in their investigations. This can help to bring about a speedier resolution to a case and lead to a successful prosecution.
 
 Proponents of CCTV cameras also point to the fact that they can act as a deterrent. If an area is known to be under surveillance, it is less likely that criminals will attempt to use it for their nefarious purposes. This can reduce the amount of crime in the area and increase the safety of the people living there.
 
 On the other hand, those who oppose CCTV cameras cite the fact that they violate a person's right to privacy. It is a violation of personal freedom to have others watching you at all times without your consent. Furthermore, there are those who worry that CCTV cameras can lead to a form of Big Brother-style surveillance of citizens, in which their movements and activities are constantly monitored. These issues of privacy and surveillance lead many to argue that the use of CCTV cameras should be regulated, if not outright banned.
 
 In conclusion, the use of CCTV cameras is a complex issue. There are those who feel that they are beneficial to society in that they can provide evidence of criminal activity and act as a deterrent. Others, however, feel that they are an invasion of privacy and believe that they should be more strictly regulated. Regardless of individual opinion, however, the fact remains that in the modern world, CCTV cameras are becoming increasingly commonplace  and their use is likely to remain a point of contention for a long time to come.";19;2668;1817;2329;2073.0
85;85;essay86.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/undergraduate-essays-2/teaching-researching-working-together-lead-success-writing-30213/;teaching and researching working together lead to the success;"Recently, the controversial debate surrounding universities has sparked interests among students and the media. Some of them deem universities principally provide training for people to be qualified employees. However, others support that it is more reasonable to set down universities as a centre of culture life where knowledge is transferred and updated. This essay will argue that the main functions of universities as the highest educational institution are teaching and researching.
 Firstly, imparting knowledge and educating people are basic duty of universities where people decide career direction and acquire more specialized knowledge and skills. Systematic and comprehensive training programs in specific fields urge people to master information required quickly and thoroughly. Nevertheless, universities are not only continuation of schooling but a platform where people start knowing more about society. The essential social capabilities such as communication skills, teamwork, leadership and time management are gradually cultivated with group workshops and various kinds of social activities in universities.
 Secondly, universities playing the most important role in education system have to guarantee the knowledge conveyed is true and useful, which can be achieved through the researching function. Old knowledge is applied to particular problems during research and solutions found often bring about innovations in culture and technology to promote human and communities to step forward.
 In conclusion, it can be seen that universities produce a great many of talents with outstanding teaching and advance the progress of human society with achievements in scientific research. Both teaching and researching working together lead to the success of today's universities.
";"Teaching and researching are two essential components of education, and when they work together, they can lead to success. Teaching is the process of imparting knowledge and skills to students, while researching involves the systematic investigation of a subject to discover new information. Working together, teaching and researching can create a powerful synergy that can lead to success in many areas.
 
 First, teaching and researching can work together to create a more effective learning environment. By combining the two, teachers can provide students with a more comprehensive understanding of a subject. For example, teachers can use research to provide students with a deeper understanding of a topic, while also teaching them the skills needed to apply that knowledge. This can help students to develop a more comprehensive understanding of a subject, which can lead to better performance in class.
 
 Second, teaching and researching can also help to create a more engaging learning experience. By combining the two, teachers can create a more interactive learning environment. For example, teachers can use research to provide students with a more in-depth look at a topic, while also teaching them the skills needed to apply that knowledge. This can help to make learning more interesting and engaging, which can lead to better performance in class.
 
 Finally, teaching and researching can also help to create a more effective learning environment. By combining the two, teachers can provide students with a more comprehensive understanding of a subject, while also teaching them the skills needed to apply that knowledge. This can help to create a more effective learning environment, which can lead to better performance in class.
 
 In conclusion, teaching and researching can work together to create a more effective learning environment. By combining the two, teachers can provide students with a more comprehensive understanding of a subject, while also teaching them the skills needed to apply that knowledge. This can help to create a more effective learning environment, which can lead to success in many areas.";"Teaching and researching working together can lead to success for many reasons. Research offers a deeper understanding of topics, preparing teachers to teach students in more meaningful ways. Conversely, teaching facilitates the application of research findings, allowing teachers to make informed decisions about how to best interact with students. Together, research and teaching can support one another and create a well-rounded learning environment that allows teachers to effectively educate their students.
 
 Research allows teachers to gain a deeper level of knowledge on their topics of teaching. It gives them an opportunity to explore the material in far more detail than they may have had the time to do in their classrooms. Research gives teachers the power to ask questions, explore, and find answers to their questions that they can then use to inform their teaching practice. By exploring their materials in a research-based way, teachers have the tools to create more meaningful learning opportunities and help students develop a deeper understanding of the material.
 
 On the other hand, teaching provides the opportunity for teachers to directly apply the results of their research. In the classroom, teachers can experiment with the new techniques and strategies they have acquired from their research, testing to see what works for their students. Through trial and error, teachers can find the best methods for engaging and educating their students, providing a learning environment that is both productive and successful.
 
 In addition to allowing teachers to make use of the research they have done, teaching also helps to inform new research. By using the latest teaching strategies, teachers can observe the results they have on their students and form their own conclusions. From these conclusions, teachers can then make suggestions for further research topics to determine how to make the learning environment more effective. This cycle of research and teaching continually creates new knowledge that can be used to help improve students understanding of the material.
 
 In conclusion, teaching and researching working together is essential to achieving success in the classroom. By combining the knowledge gained from research with the practical experience of teaching, teachers can create better learning opportunities for their students. Research allows teachers to gain a more comprehensive understanding of their material, informing their teaching. Meanwhile, teaching enables teachers to apply their newly acquired knowledge, experimenting to discover the best methods for teaching. Together, research and teaching can create an educational environment that is both improved and successful.";61;1793;2135;2728;2431.5
86;86;essay87.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/can-petrol-price-increase-impact-reducing-traffic-pollution-30195/;Can petrol price increase impact on reducing traffic and pollution?;"Nowadays, the importance of vehicles has been widely recognized thoughout the world. However, it rises concerns about the increasingly severe traffic problems as well as the automobile exhaust pollution. Some argue that the best solution to these issues is raising the price of petrol. From my perspective, I think their view is overly simplistic.
 Undeniably, making the fuel cost more money could limit the number of vehicles to some extent. Due to the increasing number of petrol stations, the competition in this field is more and more fierce, thus the price of petrol could be lower in the future. Therefore, those who are suffering from the inefficiency of public transport tend to own a car immediately. Moreover, some families purchase even more than three cars just for their own sake. In such case if they must pay more money on fuel, they may consider about that price of purchasing additionally for more time.
 Nevertheless, such an argument may restrict the real necessity of automobiles. In fact, some families really need one or two cars. For example, three family members have to work or study in three place separated so far with each other, then they need to acquire at least two cars or they may both be late. On the other hand, the development of automobile industry could be restrained as well as the employments offered by it, which could have negative effects on economy. Therefore, I can hardly agree that the solution is the best.
 From my mind, I think there are three ways tosolve these problems. Firstly, a new method of expenditure classification could be adopted. For instance, individuals had to pay much more for fuel if they possess more than three vehicles; secondly, the government should develop the public transport to meet the residents' demand; last but not least, the people should be encouraged to use electric car to reduce the car emissions.
 To conclude, I personally believe the government should take some actions such as classifying the payment, boosting the public transport and encouraging individuals to adopt the zero-emission cars, rather than raising the price of petrol, to get rid of the traffic and pollution problems.
";"The increasing cost of petrol is an issue that has been debated for many years. As petrol prices continue to rise, the impact on traffic and pollution is becoming more and more evident. This essay will discuss how an increase in petrol prices can have a positive impact on reducing traffic and pollution.
 
 The most obvious way that an increase in petrol prices can reduce traffic and pollution is by encouraging people to use alternative forms of transport. When petrol prices are high, people are more likely to use public transport, carpool, or even walk or cycle to get to their destination. This reduces the number of cars on the road, which in turn reduces the amount of air pollution caused by vehicle emissions. Additionally, public transport is often more efficient than private vehicles, meaning that fewer resources are used to transport people from one place to another.
 
 Another way that an increase in petrol prices can reduce traffic and pollution is by encouraging people to purchase more fuel-efficient vehicles. When petrol prices are high, people are more likely to purchase cars that are more fuel-efficient, which in turn reduces the amount of fuel that is used and the amount of emissions that are released into the atmosphere. Additionally, fuel-efficient vehicles are often more affordable in the long run, as they require less fuel to run and therefore cost less to maintain.
 
 Finally, an increase in petrol prices can also encourage people to drive less. When petrol prices are high, people are more likely to think twice before taking a long drive or going on a road trip. This reduces the amount of traffic on the roads, which in turn reduces the amount of air pollution caused by vehicle emissions. Additionally, it reduces the amount of fuel that is used, which helps to conserve resources and reduce the amount of emissions released into the atmosphere.
 
 In conclusion, an increase in petrol prices can have a positive impact on reducing traffic and pollution. By encouraging people to use alternative forms of transport, purchase more fuel-efficient vehicles, and drive less, the amount of traffic on the roads and the amount of air pollution caused by vehicle emissions can be significantly reduced.";"In recent years, a growing number of countries have raised the price of petrol in order to reduce traffic and pollution. The premise behind this move is that higher petrol prices will make people less inclined to drive and, as a result, reduce traffic and pollution. This essay will present the evidence that demonstrates that increased petrol prices do in fact lead to reductions in traffic and pollution, while also detailing some of the challenges that this policy can cause.
 
 The first and most obvious benefit of raising the price of petrol is the reduction in traffic. In many countries, the majority of trips are made by car, and when petrol prices increase, people are less likely to drive long distances. Research has shown that a 10 percent increase in petrol prices can result in a reduction in traffic of up to 6.1 percent. This not only reduces pollution levels, as fewer cars are on the road and they are using less fuel, but also leads to less congestion in cities and towns.
 
 Another benefit of increased petrol prices is that it encourages fuel efficiency. As petrol prices rise, people become more aware of fuel efficiency and look for ways to minimize the amount of fuel they use. This is achieved by reducing unnecessary car trips and choosing more fuel-efficient vehicles when buying a car. This lessens the amount of pollution generated by cars, and also helps reduce carbon emissions.
 
 However, there are some drawbacks that come with this policy. The most obvious is the impact it has on people with lower incomes. Increases in petrol prices disproportionately affect lower income households, as they are coming from a weaker financial position. This can lead to an increase in poverty levels, as people are unable to afford essentials such as food and utilities, due to higher petrol prices.
 
 In addition, raising petrol prices can also reduce the mobility of people. When petrol prices rise, people are less likely to take longer trips and are more restricted to their local area. This can lead to a decrease in social mobility, as people may be unable to visit family or friends, as well as an overall reduction in the quality of life in these areas.
 
 In conclusion, while increased petrol prices can effectively reduce traffic and pollution, there are also some negative impacts that this policy can cause. It is therefore important for policymakers to carefully consider the pros and cons before implementing such a policy.";67;2175;2239;2462;2350.5
87;87;essay88.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/topic-some-people-prefer-live-small-town-30079/;Prefer to live in a small town rather than a city;"Many people believe that the life in a major metropolis is convenient and interesting. Personally, however, I am in favor of living in a small town. The atmosphere in suburban area brings me peaceful feeling. Moreover, people there are very friendly. Finally, the environmental is greener than in cities. That is why I love enjoying my life in a small town.
 First and foremost, peaceful atmosphere is attractive. It is clearly seen that people in large cities face annoying noise and dirty air emitted from vehicles almost everyday. This is likely to adversely affect their mental health. Meanwhile, lives small towns are great deal more quiet and the air is always fresh. These features make a suburban town the paradise for people who want to escape from suffocating lives in major cities.
 Secondly, people in small towns are always friendly. In my experience, many people in urban areas even do not know the names of their neighbors. It is contrary in small town life, where people are ready to help whenever their neighbors are in need. The relationship among them can be so close that they usually attend the birthday party of one of their neighboring people. The affection from people around brings me cozy feeling on my birthday when I live away from my family.
 Finally, the green environment in small towns interests me. It seems to me that there are more trees and lakes in towns than in cities. It is wonderful that I get up early in the morning and take a walk in such a green place. The urban environment, however, is so artificial with only buildings and vehicles. I can not adapt myself to such an environment.
 In conclusion, I would concede that city life has its own advantages. Nonetheless, peaceful atmosphere, friendliness of people, and green landscape strongly convince me that a small town is the best place for me to live in. I love the life in my town.
 
";"Living in a small town rather than a city is a personal preference that many people make. Small towns offer a slower pace of life, a sense of community, and a variety of activities that can be enjoyed.
 
 The slower pace of life in a small town is one of the biggest draws for many people. Small towns are often less crowded than cities, and the pace of life is much slower. This can be a great benefit for those who want to take a break from the hustle and bustle of city life. In a small town, people can take the time to enjoy the simple things in life, such as taking a walk in the park or having a picnic with friends.
 
 Another benefit of living in a small town is the sense of community. Small towns often have a close-knit community, which can be a great benefit for those who want to feel like they are part of something larger than themselves. In a small town, people are often more likely to know their neighbors and be involved in the local community. This can be a great way to make friends and build relationships.
 
 Finally, small towns often offer a variety of activities that can be enjoyed. Small towns often have a variety of parks, trails, and other outdoor activities that can be enjoyed. In addition, small towns often have a variety of shops, restaurants, and other businesses that can be enjoyed. This can be a great way to explore the local culture and find new things to do.
 
 In conclusion, living in a small town rather than a city is a personal preference that many people make. Small towns offer a slower pace of life, a sense of community, and a variety of activities that can be enjoyed. For those who want to take a break from the hustle and bustle of city life, a small town can be the perfect place to call home.";"Living in a small town rather than a large city has its advantages and disadvantages, but there is a certain charm to living in a small town that many enjoy. Small towns often have a much more personal feel to them, with locals often knowing each other by name. They also provide a slower pace of life and more peaceful environment than a large city can.
 
 For one, small towns tend to be more affordable to live in than large cities. Not only are housing and rent prices typically much lower, but the cost of living in general can also be cheaper due to there being fewer amenities and services. This makes it easier to save money in the long run and not have to worry about living paycheck to paycheck.
 
 Small towns also tend to have better safety ratings than large cities. With fewer people, there is less crime and a much more neighborly feeling. The local police are often well-known by the townspeople, making it easy to feel safe and protected.
 
 In addition, small towns often have a strong sense of community and have a close-knit feel to them. With locals knowing each other and often caring for one another, it makes for a much more connected way of living than is typically found in large cities. There is also less anonymity which can make it easier to make friends and build relationships.
 
 Finally, small towns tend to be much more tranquil and have access to much more nature than cities. With less hustle and bustle and more open space, it is easier to get away from the stress of life and enjoy the beauty of the outdoors. 
 
 Overall, there is plenty of charm to living in a small town and many prefer it to a large city. With a lower cost of living, tighter community, and more access to nature, there is much to appreciate about small towns and many prefer them to large cities.";49;1883;1750;1806;1778.0
88;88;essay89.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/topic-not-everything-learned-contained-books-29921/;Knowledge from experience is more important than that from books;"The differences between knowledge from books and from experience have erupted endless controversy. Various ideas and preferences have been presented. The purpose of my writing is to deeply discuss these sources of knowledge in two important aspects: accuracy and practicability, and to show my greater interest in knowledge accumulated from experience.
 First and foremost, the accuracy of knowledge is crucially important. It is apparent that books are often written by professors, experts, or authorities in a variety of fields. Therefore, knowledge acquired from books is greatly accepted, which means that it is right to the bulk of people. Meanwhile, knowledge from experience seems a little different from information contained in books. To cite an example, it is common in books that water boils at 100 Celcius degree. However, the result is not always the same in reality because it also depends on the height, the purity of the water, and even the measuring tool. By and large, each source of knowledge has its own accuracy rate.
 Next, the practicability is one of the most essential factors of knowledge. In my experience, information contained in books is usually put in criteria so that many people can read and understand the content. Consequently, it is difficult to apply knowledge from books into practice. Whereas, it is easy to put knowledge from experience in real life because it is acquired from what have happened to them. For instance, a student decides to learn about chemical reactions from books. This method is likely to be fast, simple, and even safe. Nevertheless, there is an increased likelihood that he neither remembers the necessary information for a long time nor knows how to do an make an experiment. Meanwhile, if he goes to the library and carries out the reactions, he is certain to have a thorough grasp of the phenomena seen. He is also able to use this information for the next times. Indeed, knowledge from experience helps people more than knowledge from books does.
 In conclusion, I would concede that knowledge from books is widely accepted. However, I consider knowledge from experience as the more important source because of its negative impacts on real life. Experiencing a thing and drawing information from it is really interesting and helpful.
";"Knowledge from experience is more important than that from books. This statement is true because knowledge gained from experience is more meaningful and useful than knowledge gained from books.
 
 Experience is a powerful teacher. It is through experience that we learn the most valuable lessons in life. We learn how to interact with others, how to make decisions, and how to solve problems. We also learn how to think critically and develop our own opinions. Through experience, we gain a deeper understanding of the world around us and how to navigate it.
 
 Books, on the other hand, can provide us with a wealth of information. We can learn about history, science, and literature from books. We can also gain insight into different cultures and beliefs. However, knowledge gained from books is often limited to the facts and figures presented in the text. It does not provide us with the same level of understanding and insight that experience does.
 
 Experience also allows us to apply the knowledge we have gained from books. We can use our experience to put the information we have learned into practice. We can use our experience to make decisions, solve problems, and interact with others. We can also use our experience to develop our own opinions and ideas.
 
 In conclusion, knowledge from experience is more important than that from books. Experience provides us with a deeper understanding of the world around us and how to navigate it. It also allows us to apply the knowledge we have gained from books and develop our own opinions and ideas. Books can provide us with a wealth of information, but it is experience that provides us with the most meaningful and useful knowledge.";"Knowledge from experience is more important than that from books. This is a statement that has been argued for centuries, but with the advent of digital media and the wealth of information now available online, the importance of experience has risen. Experiences are what shape us, and the knowledge we gain from these experiences is far more valuable than the knowledge we get from books.
 
 Books provide us with a wealth of information, but they do not provide us with the personal experiences that can shape us into well-rounded people. We may learn facts, figures, and theories, but that doesnt mean that we understand the context or meaning behind them. Its only by experiencing something firsthand that we develop an understanding of it, and this understanding is far more valuable than the knowledge we get from books.
 
 Experiences also provide a level of context that books cant. We may learn about a person or place in a book, but its only by visiting the person or place that we develop a real understanding of its culture, identity, and values. Experiences provide us with more than just knowledge; they provide us with memories, perspectives, and emotions that cannot be found in books.
 
 Finally, books cannot provide us with the lessons in resilience and problem solving that we gain from experience. We may understand problems and challenges that we face on an intellectual level, but its only by experiencing them that we can truly understand the difficulty and develop the necessary skills to overcome them.
 
 In conclusion, while books may give us a wealth of information, they cannot provide us with the context, memories, perspectives, and lessons in resilience and problem solving that experience can. For this reason, the knowledge gained from experience is undoubtedly more important than the knowledge we get from books.";64;2300;1695;1849;1772.0
89;89;essay90.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/solve-traffic-housing-problems-moving-companies-rural-areas-29919/;Solve traffic and housing problems by moving companies to the rural areas?;"With the booming development of some cosmopolitan metropolises in recent years, an increasing number of people are flooding into these major cities, raising such urban problems as traffic jams or housing shortage. In such cases, some people think an effective way to tackle these problems is to relocate big firms, factories and their employees in cities to the countryside. However, from my perspective, I suppose this suggestion is not advisable, for it cannot alter the situation essentially and instead it may give rise to new concerns in rural areas.
 Admittedly, moving big companies, factories and their employees to the rural area can help ease traffic congestion and housing scarcity. As people work in the countryside, they will not have to commute in cities at peak times such as eight o'clock in the morning or six o'clock in the afternoon. Consequently, urban traffic jam can be, to some extent, relieved in this respect. On the other hand, the relocation of companies and factories in cities may leave more space to build new residential areas, thus alleviating the urban housing crisis at present.
 However, the proposed measure is not fundamental to resolve urban traffic and housing problems. This is because some employees are reluctant to live in the rural areas only due to the relocation of their workplaces. This can be best illustrated with the example of the married workers. Taking into the growth of their children into consideration, the married workers may believe the educational resources in cities are far superior to ones in the countryside, and because of this, they probably opt for living in the cities. Thus, these employers have to commute between the cities and the countryside, which is ineffective in tackling traffic and housing problems. What is worse, the workers have to consume more time and traffic fees.
 Also, the suggested step can bring about environmental problems in the rural areas. As companies and factories move to the countryside, they may deplete the local natural resources as the raw materials for production. Besides, the untreated pollutants the plants discharge can be damaging to the rural environment .Therefore, moving companies, factories and employees to the rural areas can ruin the environment there.
 Overall, I would conclude that relocating big firms, factories and their employees is not sensible to address urban traffic and housing problems. Instead, the government should be forward-looking, resolving the problems within the cities.
";"The world is becoming increasingly urbanized, with more and more people moving to cities in search of better opportunities. This has led to a number of problems, including traffic congestion and a lack of affordable housing. To address these issues, some have proposed moving companies to rural areas. This solution has the potential to reduce traffic and housing problems in cities, while also providing economic opportunities to rural areas.
 
 The primary benefit of moving companies to rural areas is that it would reduce traffic congestion in cities. By relocating businesses to rural areas, the number of people commuting to and from work would be reduced. This would lead to fewer cars on the roads, resulting in less traffic and fewer delays. Additionally, it would reduce the need for parking spaces in cities, freeing up more land for other uses.
 
 Moving companies to rural areas would also help to address the housing crisis in cities. By relocating businesses, more people would be able to live in cities, as there would be fewer people commuting to work. This would reduce the demand for housing, making it more affordable for those who need it. Additionally, it would create more jobs in rural areas, providing economic opportunities to those who live there.
 
 Finally, moving companies to rural areas would help to reduce the environmental impact of cities. By reducing the number of cars on the roads, air pollution would be reduced, leading to improved air quality. Additionally, it would reduce the amount of energy used for commuting, resulting in fewer greenhouse gas emissions.
 
 In conclusion, moving companies to rural areas has the potential to reduce traffic and housing problems in cities, while also providing economic opportunities to rural areas. It would reduce the number of cars on the roads, leading to less traffic and fewer delays. It would also reduce the demand for housing, making it more affordable for those who need it. Finally, it would reduce the environmental impact of cities, leading to improved air quality and fewer greenhouse gas emissions.";"The world today is full of bustling cities, packed with businesses, people, and countless other activities. Unfortunately, these cities are also often full of traffic and housing problems. These issues can be incredibly difficult to adequately address, as urban populations continually increase and resources spread thin. Fortunately, one solution to these problems that is being explored is to move business out of the cities and into rural areas.
 
 By moving businesses to the rural areas, the congestion in cities would naturally decrease. This would reduce the amount of traffic on the roads, making for a much more pleasant commute for the citizens that still live in the city. It would also reduce the demand for housing in the city, as the population of workers would naturally decrease. This could in turn reduce the pressure of rising housing costs that many city dwellers experience.
 
 Relocating a business to the rural areas would also have many benefits for the rural areas themselves. For example, it would bring new jobs to the region, helping to boost its economy. In addition, it could also help stimulate the local housing market, as employees will need a place to live close to their place of work.
 
 However, moving companies to rural areas is not a perfect solution. Businesses may require more in terms of utilities, such as high-speed internet and electricity, which could be an issue in areas that are not as developed as the cities. Additionally, although it would reduce the congestion in cities, it could lead to added traffic to the rural areas if the new businesses attract a large workforce.
 
 Overall, moving businesses to rural areas could be a great way to help solve traffic and housing problems in cities. While it is not a perfect solution, it could certainly provide some relief. With the right measures in place, it could also be a great way to help spur rural development, create new jobs, and reduce the strain on urban populations.";74;2511;2093;1976;2034.5
