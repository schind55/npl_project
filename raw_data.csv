0;essay01.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/essay-should-students-taught-compete-cooperate-6788/;Should students be taught to compete or to cooperate?;"It is always said that competition can effectively promote the development of economy. In order to survive in the competition, companies continue to improve their products and service, and as a result, the whole society prospers. However, when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation, what we are concerned about is not the whole society, but the development of an individual's whole life. From this point of view, I firmly believe that we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education.
 First of all, through cooperation, children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students. What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly, how to get along with others. During the process of cooperation, children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others, how to communicate with others, how to think comprehensively, and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred. All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life.
 On the other hand, the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory. Hence it is always said that competition makes the society more effective. However, when we consider about the question that how to win the game, we always find that we need the cooperation. The greater our goal is, the more competition we need. Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance, it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach, and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet, and those who are in charge of the medical care. The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team. Therefore without the cooperation, there would be no victory of competition.
 Consequently, no matter from the view of individual development or the relationship between competition and cooperation we can receive the same conclusion that a more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one's success.";"The debate over whether students should be taught to compete or to cooperate has been ongoing for many years. On one hand, competition can be a powerful motivator and can help students to strive for excellence. On the other hand, cooperation can foster a sense of community and help students to develop important social skills. Ultimately, the answer to this question depends on the individual student and the context in which they are learning.
 
 Competition can be a powerful motivator for students. It can help them to strive for excellence and push themselves to achieve their goals. Competition can also help to create a sense of accountability and responsibility, as students are held accountable for their own performance. Furthermore, competition can help to foster a sense of pride and accomplishment when students are successful.
 
 On the other hand, cooperation can be beneficial for students as well. It can help to foster a sense of community and collaboration among students, which can be beneficial for their social and emotional development. Cooperation can also help to promote problem-solving skills, as students must work together to come up with solutions to challenges. Furthermore, cooperation can help to foster a sense of empathy and understanding, as students learn to work together and appreciate different perspectives.
 
 Ultimately, the answer to this question depends on the individual student and the context in which they are learning. For some students, competition may be the best way to motivate them and help them to reach their goals. For other students, cooperation may be the best way to foster a sense of community and collaboration. It is important for educators to assess the individual needs of their students and create an environment that is conducive to both competition and cooperation.
 
 In conclusion, both competition and cooperation can be beneficial for students. It is important for educators to assess the individual needs of their students and create an environment that is conducive to both competition and cooperation. By doing so, students can benefit from the positive aspects of both competition and cooperation and reach their full potential.";"It is important to consider both sides of the argument when discussing whether or not students should be taught to compete or cooperate. On the one hand, competition can be a powerful motivating force in students. A competitive atmosphere can push students to go beyond what they previously thought was possible and strive for excellence. It is also important to consider the long-term benefits of teaching students to be competitive, as this can give them an edge in the job market after graduation. 
 
 On the other hand, an environment where competition is so heavily emphasized can make students less likely to collaborate and share ideas. This can lead to a destructive every man for himself mentality that is not conducive to a productive learning environment. Furthermore, a focus on competition can create an atmosphere of anxiety and stress that can be detrimental to students mental health. Instead, teaching students to work together and cooperate with one another can foster a sense of community among their peers.
 
 Ultimately, there is not one right answer when it comes to teaching students to either compete or cooperate. The ideal solution is likely a balance of the two. Students should be taught the importance of excelling and pushing themselves to reach their full potential, but also be encouraged to learn from one another and engage in meaningful collaboration. By teaching students to use competition and cooperation in an appropriate manner, we can ensure that they are well-prepared for the challenges of the future.";53;2180;2206;1544;1875.0
1;essay02.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/essay-more-people-migrating-other-countries-than-ever-before-53351/;More people are migrating to other countries than ever before;"The last 50 years have seen an increasing number of immigrants to other countries. People moved due to a number of reasons, namely better educations or higher salary jobs. Some people thought that they should follow the local customs in order to integrate into their adopted countries’ cultures. However I strongly believe that they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values.
 Firstly, maintaining one’s cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments. Take Australia for example, immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues. Many Australians come this day to enjoy the shows, learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values. These feedbacks, in turn, help raise one’s pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more. Thus this makes it clear that sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential.
 Secondly, it is crucial to keep one’s identity for they need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin. For instance, children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends. In this new environment, parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home. Fail to create this familiarity makes them felt isolated, in the extreme can lead to social disorder like autism. Hence, it is clear that keeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is tremendous important.
 To conclude, although there are opposing ideas of neglecting one’s cultural values to adapt in the new cultures. As far as I am concerned, sustaining the traditions will make the immigrated people keep their cultural identity and give them confident among the many culture society.";"In recent years, the number of people migrating to other countries has increased dramatically. This phenomenon has been driven by a variety of factors, including economic opportunity, political instability, and environmental disasters. As a result, more people than ever before are leaving their home countries in search of a better life elsewhere.
 
 The economic benefits of migration are often the primary motivation for people to move. Many people migrate to countries with higher wages and better job prospects. This is especially true for people from developing countries, where wages are often much lower than in developed countries. In addition, people may migrate to countries with more stable economies, which can provide greater economic security.
 
 Political instability is another major factor driving migration. People may flee their home countries due to civil war, political repression, or other forms of violence. In some cases, people may also migrate to escape oppressive governments or to seek asylum from persecution.
 
 Environmental disasters can also lead to migration. For example, people may be forced to leave their homes due to floods, droughts, or other natural disasters. In addition, people may migrate to escape the effects of climate change, such as rising sea levels or extreme weather events.
 
 The increasing number of people migrating to other countries has had a profound impact on the world. It has led to a greater diversity of cultures and ideas, as well as increased economic growth in many countries. However, it has also caused a number of challenges, such as increased competition for jobs and resources, and the potential for social unrest.
 
 In conclusion, more people are migrating to other countries than ever before. This trend is driven by a variety of factors, including economic opportunity, political instability, and environmental disasters. While this phenomenon has had a number of positive effects, it has also caused a number of challenges that must be addressed.";"In recent years, the phenomenon of people migrating to other countries has been steadily on the rise. Although this trend has been growing since the start of the 20th century, the forces driving this mobility of individuals, couples and families from one nation to another have only grown in intensity in recent times.
 
 When examining the causes of migration, one can cite economic factors such as globalisation, the expansion of economic opportunities and the creation of a more connected world, which often leads people to leave their home countries in search of a better life. For many, this can mean finding higher-paying jobs, accessing improved standards of living, or escaping poverty and oppressive governments. It is also worth noting that the mobility of people can often be driven by the search of freedom and the ability to exercise their basic human rights.
 
 In addition, this migration trend is being driven by larger numbers of refugees from many countries, as conflicts, political instability and climate change have forced people to flee their homelands for safety and security. This can also be seen in the European continent, where the recent migration crisis has drastically changed the social, economic and political landscape of the region.
 
 Finally, technology has played an important role in the increasing numbers of people migrating to other countries. New easy-to-use platforms have allowed more people to cross borders with relative ease and security, and have been a major catalyst in the mobility of individuals in the modern world.
 
 In conclusion, it is clear that there are many different factors behind the trend of more people migrating to other countries than ever before, such as economic development, the search for freedom, the refugee crisis and the role of technology. As this trend continues, governments and international organisations must find ways to ensure that migration is managed in a secure, legal and humane manner.";61;2018;2025;1974;1999.5
2;essay03.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/essay-international-tourism-now-more-common-than-ever-before-53202/;International tourism is now more common than ever before (for);"The last decade has seen an increasing number of tourists travelling to visit natural wonder sights, ancient heritages and different cultures around the world. While some people might think that this international tourism has negative effects on the destination countries, I would contend that it has contributed to the economic development as well as preserved the culture and environment of the tourist destinations. 
 Firstly, international tourism promotes many aspects of the destination country’s economy in order to serve various demands of tourists. Take Cambodia for example, a large number of visitors coming to visit the Angkowat ancient temple need services like restaurants, hotels, souvenir shops and other stores. These demands trigger related business in the surrounding settings which in turn create many jobs for local people improve infrastructure and living standard. Therefore tourism has clearly improved lives in the tourist country.
 Secondly, through tourism industry, many cultural values have been preserved and natural environments have been protected. For instance, in Vietnam, many cultural costumes and natural scenes, namely ‘Trong Dong’ drum performance and ‘Ha Long’ bay, are being encouraged to preserve and funded by the tourism ministry. Without this support and profit from tourism, many traditional cultures would disappear due to its low income works. Thus, tourism has survived many non-tangible cultural values and beauty scenes. 
 To conclude, as far as I am concerned, international tourism has both triggered economic development and maintained cultural and environment values of the tourist countries. In addition, the authorities should adequately support these sustainable developments.";"International tourism has become increasingly popular in recent years, with more and more people travelling to different countries to experience different cultures and explore new places. This is due to a number of factors, such as the rise of technology, the growth of the global economy, and the increasing affordability of international travel.
 
 The development of technology has made international travel much easier and more accessible. The internet has made it easier to research and book flights, hotels, and other travel arrangements, while mobile phones and other devices have made it easier to stay connected while travelling. This has made it much easier for people to plan and book their own trips, without relying on travel agents or other third parties.
 
 The growth of the global economy has also made international travel more affordable. The cost of flights and accommodation has decreased significantly in recent years, making it much more affordable for people to travel to different countries. This has been further aided by the emergence of budget airlines, which have made it much easier for people to travel to different countries without breaking the bank.
 
 Finally, the increasing availability of information has made it much easier for people to learn about different cultures and destinations. The internet has made it much easier for people to research different countries and cultures, and to find out about the best places to visit. This has made it much easier for people to plan their trips and to make the most of their time abroad.
 
 Overall, international tourism has become much more common in recent years, due to the rise of technology, the growth of the global economy, and the increasing availability of information. This has made it much easier and more affordable for people to travel to different countries, and to experience different cultures and explore new places.";"International tourism has emerged as one of the most prominent industries of the 21st century, generating tremendous economic growth and creating employment for millions of people. The rise of international tourism has been driven by technological advances, increasing globalisation and the economic benefits that it brings to both host countries and tourists alike. As a result of this, international tourism has become more common than ever before.
 
 One of the key drivers behind the growth of international tourism is the growth of technology. Advances in transport infrastructure, such as air travel, have enabled tourism to become increasingly global. The internet has also opened up international tourism to a new generation of potential visitors, providing access to a wealth of information, deals and booking options. This has allowed tourists to easily access to countries that were previously out of reach and has made it easier and more affordable for international tourists to travel.
 
 Economic benefits of international tourism are also a major factor driving its growth. Tourism contributes to global economic growth by creating jobs and generating income, particularly in developing countries. It has a number of direct economic benefits such as foreign exchange earnings and taxes, as well as indirect benefits such as increased investment and infrastructure development. Tourism also plays an important role in creating opportunities for cultural exchange, allowing for the sharing of knowledge and ideas between people from different countries.
 
 Furthermore, globalisation has opened up new opportunities for international tourism. Globalisation has facilitated the growth of economies and made it easier for people to travel and explore countries beyond their own borders. This has increased the diversity of international tourists, encouraging people to travel for educational, cultural and leisure purposes. The emergence of social media platforms has also provided a platform to promote international tourism, allowing tourists to share their experiences with the world and inspiring others to visit and explore new destinations.
 
 In conclusion, international tourism has become more common than ever before and has had a hugely positive impact on the global economy. Technological advances and greater globalisation have opened up new opportunities, while the economic benefits of tourism have created jobs and generated income, particularly in developing countries. In addition, it has allowed for cultural exchange and has inspired many people to explore and learn about new places and cultures. All of this has combined to make international tourism even more popular and accessible than ever before.";63;1734;1917;2734;2325.5
3;essay04.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/essay-international-tourism-now-more-common-than-ever-before-53202/;International tourism is now more common than ever before (against);"The last 50 years have seen a significant increase in the number of tourist travelling worldwide. While some might think the tourism bring large profit for the destination countries, I would contend that this industry has affected the cultural attributes and damaged the natural environment of the tourist destinations.
 Firstly, it is an undeniable fact that tourists from different cultures will probably cause changes to the cultural identity of the tourist destinations. Take Thailand for example, in the Vietnam War, many American soldiers came to Thailand for a break and involved in sexual and drug activities, these huge demands caused many local businesses opened and expanded, even illegally involved in under-age prostitutes to maximise their profits. This was due to the lack of adequate controls by authorities and lead to a bad image of Thailand tourism. Therefore this proves that international tourism can create negative impacts on the destination countries.
 Secondly, there are clear evidences that tourism increasingly create harms to the natural habitats of the destination appeals. As the Australia’s Great Barrier Reef has shown, the billion visitors per annum has generated immense destruction to this nature wonder, namely breaking the corals caused by walking or throwing boat’s anchors, dropping fuel and other sorts of pollutions. For this reason, many marine lives have been endangered, in the extremes part of the reef become uninhabitable for these marine species. Thus, it is apparent that tourism has threatened the nature environments.
 To conclude, I strongly believe that the tourism has created threatening pressure on both the sociocultural and natural environments. If authorities do not take steps to appropriately conserve these precious values, they will be destroyed in the near future.";"International tourism has become increasingly popular in recent years, with more and more people travelling abroad for leisure and business. While this trend has brought many benefits, it has also had some negative impacts on the environment, local cultures, and economies.
 
 The environmental impact of international tourism is undeniable. Air travel is one of the most polluting forms of transportation, and the number of flights taken by tourists has increased significantly in recent years. This has led to an increase in carbon emissions and other pollutants, which can have a damaging effect on the environment. Additionally, the large number of tourists visiting certain destinations can lead to overcrowding and overuse of natural resources, such as water and energy.
 
 The influx of tourists to certain destinations can also have a negative impact on local cultures. Tourists often bring with them their own cultural values and practices, which can clash with those of the local population. This can lead to a feeling of alienation among the locals, as their culture is seen as inferior to that of the tourists. Furthermore, the presence of tourists can lead to the commodification of local culture, as it is used to attract more visitors.
 
 Finally, international tourism can have a detrimental effect on local economies. While tourism can bring in much-needed revenue, it can also lead to a decrease in wages for local workers. This is because tourists often prefer to use services provided by foreign companies, which can lead to a decrease in demand for local services. Additionally, the presence of tourists can lead to an increase in prices for goods and services, which can make them unaffordable for locals.
 
 In conclusion, while international tourism can bring many benefits, it can also have some negative impacts on the environment, local cultures, and economies. Therefore, it is important to ensure that tourism is managed responsibly and that the benefits are shared fairly among all stakeholders.";"International tourism is becoming increasingly popular and it is now easier than ever for people of any nationality or economic status to travel overseas. However, this rise in global tourism is not without its difficulties and there are many reasons why it should not be encouraged.
 
 To begin with, the environmental impact of international travel is significant. Air travel, in particular, has a huge impact on the environment and is one of the major contributors to global warming. The additional emissions created by the ever increasing number of planes taking off each day is unsustainable and could have a devastating effect on the earths climate in the future. Furthermore, the resources needed to fuel the planes and create the infrastructure to accommodate the growing number of tourists also has a negative impact on the environment, with the destruction of forests, water pollution and other forms of damage caused by tourism-related activities.
 
 In addition, an increase in global tourism brings with it a range of other social and cultural implications. With more people travelling abroad, there is a greater risk of the spread of disease between different countries, as well as increased cultural clashes as different nationalities come into contact with one another. In addition, the influx of tourists can often lead to the exploitation of resources and local cultures, as businesses seek to capitalize on the tourism industry. This can lead to a displacement of local people, with their traditional lifestyles disrupted as businesses take advantage of their land in order to make a profit from tourists.
 
 Finally, the proliferation of international tourism can lead to vast regional inequalities, as countries with a large number of tourists tend to benefit greatly from the additional income and infrastructure that it provides, whilst countries which are less popular with tourists are often left behind in terms of economic growth and development. This can accelerate the gap between the worlds poorest and wealthiest nations, leading to a disproportionate distribution of wealth.
 
 For these reasons, it is clear that international tourism should not be encouraged, and should instead be discouraged by governments and citizens alike. The resources and efforts of the tourism industry should instead be focused on sustainable forms of travel, so that the people of the world can travel without damaging the planet or contributing to regional inequalities.";67;1829;2025;2483;2254.0
4;essay05.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/essay-living-studying-overseas-7203/;Living and studying overseas;"It is every student's desire to study at a good university and experience a new environment. While some students study and live overseas to achieve this, some prefer to study home because of the difficulties of living and studying overseas. In my opinion, one who studies overseas will gain many skills throughout this experience for several reasons.
 First, studying at an overseas university gives individuals the opportunity to improve social skills by interacting and communicating with students from different origins and cultures. Compared to the peers studying in the home country, it will be more likely for the one who is living overseas to be successful in adapting himself/herself into new environments and situations in life.
 Second, living and studying overseas is an irreplaceable experience when it comes to learn standing on your own feet.

 When studying overseas, it is important to be prepared for the cultural differences that may exist. It is important to be open-minded and willing to learn about the culture of the country you are visiting. This can include learning about the language, customs, and traditions of the country. It is also important to be aware of the laws and regulations of the country, as these may differ from those of your home country.
 
 In addition to the cultural differences, there are also academic differences to consider. It is important to research the academic system of the country you are visiting, as this may differ from the system you are used to. This includes the grading system, the types of courses offered, and the expectations of the professors. It is also important to be aware of the cost of living and tuition fees, as these may be higher than in your home country.
 
 Living and studying overseas can also be a great opportunity to make new friends and connections. It is important to take advantage of the opportunity to meet people from different backgrounds and cultures. This can help to broaden your horizons and provide you with a unique perspective on life.

 Overall, living and studying overseas can be an incredibly rewarding experience. It can open up a world of opportunities and provide a unique perspective on life. However, it is important to be prepared for the challenges that may arise and to take advantage of the opportunity to make new friends and connections.";"Living and studying overseas is a profound experience that can challenge, grow, and shape individuals into independent and global citizens who are better prepared to take on the world with confidence. As such, it has become increasingly popular, especially amongst students looking to expand their international exposure.
 
 Studying overseas offers students an opportunity to experience a different culture and lifestyle, allowing them to observe the way their host country approaches education, work, and life in general. This can often lead to personal growth and a greater appreciation for one's own culture and traditions. Furthermore, a student who has the opportunity to live and study in another country may gain invaluable first-hand knowledge of international business, politics, and trade, and be able to develop fluency in multiple languages.
 
 In addition, studying and living overseas often provides students with unique cross-cultural understanding and communication skills. By engaging in multicultural living, students learn to develop and maintain relationships with people from different backgrounds and walks of life, often leading to development of more effective conflict resolution skills. Consequently, these newly acquired skills are invaluable to any future career path.
 
 Eager students often find the adventure and excitement of living and studying overseas to be quite appealing. From traveling to new places, to trying new foods and customs, the experience can often promote a sense of self-discovery and open-mindedness, as well as adding to ones overall growth and development.
 
 Overall, the opportunity to live and study overseas is a valuable learning experience for anyone interested in broadening their horizons and interacting with people from different cultural backgrounds. While it can be a challenge to adjust to a different lifestyle, the chance to gain new perspectives, skills, and knowledge generally makes it worthwhile.";28;1628;2117;1970;2043.5
5;essay06.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/persuasive-essay-should-exercise-40115/;Why you should exercise;"More than 1.6 billion people in the world are either overweight or obese and United States has the highest rate of obesity. America's number one killer is cardiovascular diseases, which can easily be prevented by exercising. Exercise not only reduces the risk of health problems and various diseases, but it also has an effect on overall appearance. It is proven that exercising and being active can improve self-esteem and confidence. Excerising is one of the most important things in life and it can even be fun. It is a crucial element for living a healthier, longer, and happier life. 
 The number one reason why people should exercise is because it will keep you healthy. Americans are eating enormous amounts of fast foods these days, so cardiovascular diseases are becoming more and more common. One out of every four Americans are suffering from some form of cardiovascular diseases, which results in more than forty-five percent of deaths annually. The main cause for this condition is obesity. The more body fat that you have, the greater your risk for heart disease. However, this condition can easily be prevented or controlled by exercising. Exercising makes the heart muscles stronger. When your heart muscle is strong it can do the same amount of work at a lower heart rate, so the heart doesn't have to work as hard as it does with weak muscles. In today's society people are less concerned with the food they eat and their physical condition, so many serious illnesses are becoming quite common. Exercising not only helps prevent cardiovascular diseases, but it also helps prevent strokes, type 2 diabetes, and even certain types of cancer. 
 The second benefit to exercising is that it improves self-esteem and confidence. Most people think of exercising as only being a physical activity, but it's also a mental activity. There have been studies that show evidence that people who exercise have higher self esteem and confidence. It also showed that active people are less likely to have depression and anxiety. Exercising gives people energy, which helps people have positive outlooks on life and it helps relieves tension and stress. When you exercise you body releases endorphins, which are chemicals that create a happy feeling in brain. Plus, when you're exercising you're bringing more oxygen into you lungs and your brain appreciates the extra air. Exercising also helps improve you brain function and your memory.
 In my opinion the best reason to exercise is that it's really fun! Most people think that exercising takes up a lot of time and it requires too much work. When people actually take the time to try exercising they realize it's an enjoyable experience. It doesn't matter how you exercise, as long as you are being active. Everyone enjoys different sports or activities, so it's important to figure out which is best for you. When you having fun you don't even realize that your exercising and you look forward to it everyday. Setting goals and rewards will help you stay motivated and consistent with exercising. There is no greater feeling than achieving a weight lose goal and being able to feel good about your body. It makes exercising well worth it.

Many people come up with plenty of excuses to not exercise; however, if you truly want to improve your mental and physical health you will find the energy and time to exercise.

6;essay07.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/essay-newspapers-soon-become-thing-past-6887/;Will newspapers become a thing of the past?;"The internet has been more and more popular for recent years, providing people with a huge source of information. As a result of this, print media such as newspapers have experienced a dramatic decline in the number of readers. Some people, however, still believe that they can exist for long time; others disagree, arguing that newspapers have lost their competitive advantage to sustain their prolonged existence. Personally, I am inclined to agree with the latter view for following reasons.
 First of all, to obtain information, using the internet is quicker and more convenient than reading newspapers. Contrary to the past when people had to wait long hours to take a daily newspaper, nowadays, they can acquire latest news updated every second through their mobile phones or computers connected to the internet, everywhere and at anytime. As can be seen, these devices and machines are very common in all parts of the world, making it easier for people to read a number of things that newspapers can not provide in only some pages. Hence, the print media has failed to keep its important role in the provision of information.
 Another point is that, from the economic aspect, buying newspapers appears to be a waste of money when the internet becomes available for every one. It is clear to recognize that the internet service is being provided at a low cost or even free in many countries. The question arises as to whether or not a person spends an extra money buying newspapers to receive the same, even usually less information than those he can have with the internet? The answer, perhaps, is that hardly would rational people do so. For this reason, the number of people reading newspapers may continue falling sharply, possibly leading to the close-downs of many in the coming time.
 Last, but not least, when taking environment into consideration, people must conceive that the more newspapers are published, the more trees are cut down. This is simply the contributor to the deforestation which is happening all over the world today. At this point, newspapers' production will have to face environmentalists on its way to be alive.
 In conclusion, it might be unpleasant for some advocating newspapers to witness the extinction of the type of media. However, this, if occurring, should be seen as a result of the ever- increasing innovations in media technology and in our modern life as a whole.
";"The question of whether newspapers will become a thing of the past is one that has been debated for many years. With the rise of digital media, it is clear that the traditional newspaper industry is in decline. However, it is important to consider whether newspapers will become completely obsolete or if they will continue to exist in some form.
 
 The most obvious reason why newspapers may become a thing of the past is the rise of digital media. With the advent of the internet and the proliferation of smartphones, people now have access to a wealth of information at their fingertips. This has led to a decrease in the demand for traditional newspapers, as people can now get their news from a variety of digital sources. Additionally, digital media is often more convenient and cost-effective than print media, making it an attractive option for many people.
 
 However, it is important to consider that newspapers may still have a place in the future. Despite the rise of digital media, there are still many people who prefer to read a physical newspaper. This is especially true for older generations, who may not be as comfortable with digital media. Additionally, newspapers can provide a more in-depth and comprehensive look at a story than digital media, which often focuses on the headline and the most important facts. This can be beneficial for those who want to gain a deeper understanding of a particular issue.
 
 Ultimately, it is difficult to say whether newspapers will become a thing of the past. While it is clear that the traditional newspaper industry is in decline, there are still many people who prefer to read a physical newspaper. Additionally, newspapers can provide a more comprehensive look at a story than digital media, which could be beneficial for those who want to gain a deeper understanding of a particular issue. For these reasons, it is likely that newspapers will continue to exist in some form in the future.";"Will newspapers become a thing of the past? This is a question that many have asked in recent years. The long-held tradition of reading a newspaper over a cup of coffee in the morning is slowly becoming a distant memory. With the proliferation of web-based news outlets and the availability of so much information at the click of a button, the standard daily newspaper may soon become obsolete. 
 
 In recent years, news outlets have transitioned from a print-based business to an online industry. Many newspapers have taken to the Internet, providing their readers with news through websites and online magazines. In addition, social media has had a huge impact on how people source their news. The ability to share news stories through Twitter, Facebook and other social networks has allowed journalists and news outlets to reach readers in ways that were never before possible. This has resulted in an information overload, where readers have access to more news outlets than ever before. 
 
 As news outlets transition to the web, it has become increasingly difficult for newspapers to keep pace. Traditional newspapers have limited funds to invest in web-based technology and staff, making them unable to compete with the larger online news sites. Also, newspapers are struggling to adjust to the shorter attention span of the modern reader. Readers now expect to find their news quickly and easily, and newspapers are struggling to keep up with the demand for continuously updated information. 
 
 Traditional newspapers have also been struggling to keep up with the increasing competition from free online news sources. Online news outlets have no printing or distributing costs, and can therefore offer their readers free news content. In addition, online sources are often quicker to post breaking stories than traditional newspapers, providing an instant news source that people can access anywhere.
 
 It is clear that traditional newspapers are struggling to keep up with the digital age. As readers increasingly turn to online news sources, newspapers are struggling to remain relevant in the modern world. With the ever-increasing availability of online news, it seems inevitable that the age of the traditional newspaper is coming to an end.";43;2413;1953;2256;2104.5
7;essay08.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/technology-cannot-solve-all-worlds-problems-53462/;Technology cannot solve all the world's problems;"In our modern times, with the development of science and technology, our living standard has been improved beyond recognition. Technology, however, is not the best solution to all the world's intricate problems. Accordingly, it is believed that we need to place less emphasis on technological solutions and more on other values, such as economy, politics and education. Personally, I partly disagree with this point of view, and the reasons are given below.
 To begin with, it should be borne in mind that technology plays an integral part in our lives. With the invention of computers and the Internet, we now can get easy access to all kinds of information. In addition, hi-tech devices also have a very positive impact on many aspects of our lives. They help us to work and study more efficiently, thus leading to an improvement in our abilities. Medical advances can improve our health and cure many fatal diseases. Besides, modern technology enables us to predict natural disasters much faster and more accurately, so we can reduce the number of deaths and property damage.
 However, there are some serious problems springing from modern technology. First, deadly and powerful weapons can be a huge threat to the world's peace. Second, a lot of people spend too much time using hi-tech devices nowadays. They abuse them so severely that they feel they can hardly live without them. This can have a detrimental effect on their health, since they are likely to develop many dangerous diseases, including obesity, heart attack and high blood-pressure.
 In conclusion, although there is no disputing the fact that technology is very crucial for our lives, in can also result in several negative drawbacks. However, I strongly believe that its advantages clearly outweigh its disadvantages, and that it can contribute greatly to the development of the world. Therefore, scientists should not place less emphasis on technological solutions, but try to pay more attention to develop new technologies instead.";"Technology has become an integral part of our lives, and it has revolutionized the way we live, work, and play. It has made our lives easier and more efficient, and it has opened up new possibilities for communication, entertainment, and education. However, while technology has been a great boon to humanity, it cannot solve all the worlds problems.
 
 Technology can help us address some of the worlds most pressing issues, such as poverty, hunger, and disease. For example, technology can be used to develop new medicines, improve agricultural production, and create new sources of energy. However, technology alone cannot solve these problems. To truly address these issues, we need to look beyond technology and focus on the underlying causes of poverty, hunger, and disease. This means addressing issues such as inequality, lack of access to education, and lack of access to healthcare.
 
 Technology can also help us address environmental issues, such as climate change and pollution. Technology can be used to develop renewable energy sources, reduce emissions, and create more efficient ways of using resources. However, technology alone cannot solve these problems. To truly address these issues, we need to look beyond technology and focus on the underlying causes of climate change and pollution, such as overconsumption, deforestation, and unsustainable agricultural practices.
 
 In addition, technology cannot solve social issues such as racism, sexism, and homophobia. Technology can be used to create tools that help us combat these issues, such as social media campaigns and online education programs. However, technology alone cannot solve these issues. To truly address these issues, we need to look beyond technology and focus on the underlying causes of racism, sexism, and homophobia, such as systemic inequality and lack of access to resources.
 
 In conclusion, while technology can be a great tool for addressing some of the worlds most pressing issues, it cannot solve all the worlds problems. To truly address these issues, we need to look beyond technology and focus on the underlying causes of poverty, hunger, disease, climate change, and social issues. Only then can we create lasting solutions that will benefit all of humanity.";"Since the advent of the modern age, technology has been hailed as a revolutionary force for the betterment of humanity. But unfortunately, the technology that we possess today is inadequate to definitively solve the worlds problems. While technology may provide helpful guidance and aid in the resolution of global issues, it cannot be viewed as an ultimate solution. 
 
 For starters, there are a number of issues that technology cannot directly address. Poverty, inequality, and social injustice are all social issues that require a multi-faceted solution, not one that comes down to a single invention or breakthrough. Similarly, more abstract concerns such as migration, pollution, and environmental degradation require a complex and systemic approach, one for which technology provides only a partial answer. 
 
 In addition, technology is limited by the fact that it is often misused or abused. As technology is designed and developed, it is done so by people with their own personal interests, which can lead to bias or manipulation of resources. This can lead to technology becoming an instrument of oppression, rather than a tool for progress. In other cases, technology is used to exploit the vulnerable, such as when it is used to monitor individuals or to manipulate public opinion. 
 
 Finally, it is important to remember that technology does not exist in a vacuum; it is a product of the environment it is used in. Technology only works as well as its users, and can be easily limited by infrastructure, economic conditions, and other practical constraints. Additionally, even if technology is successful in addressing certain issues, its success is hindered by a lack of education, resources, and commitment from the people who are supposed to make it work. 
 
 In short, while technology can provide useful assistance in resolving some of the worlds problems, it is important to remember that it cannot be a one-stop solution. Technology requires thoughtful and responsible use, and it must be integrated into a multi-faceted approach that takes into account the complexity of the issues at hand. Only by understanding and acknowledging its limits can technology be used in a way that benefits all of humanity.";48;2006;2261;2227;2244.0
8;essay09.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/undergraduate-essays-2/marijuana-persuasive-essay-41857/;The Truth About Cannabis;"Is marijuana as bad as society makes it out to be? Since the 1930's marijuana has been illegal in the United States. That being said it's somehow America's number one cash crop. Users of the drug aren't the only ones who support cannabis; many of us who do not indulge are pro-legalization because we see that prohibition does more harm than good.
 The legalization of marijuana would help get the economy going again. Despite great efforts by the federal government against marijuana, it has become a large part of the national economy. Imagine if we were to legalize and tax it, the government would make tons of profit and we could start paying off this $16trillion national debt. Not to mention it would create tons of jobs and people in prison for marijuana crimes would be released. In a country with only 5% of the earth's population, the United States holds 25% of the world's prisoners (""Marijuana Prison Statistics""). A significant amount of those criminals are in there for drug related crimes.
 The war on drugs is a complete failure. It's done nothing but waste tax payer dollars, fill prisons with non violent criminals, and create a black market. The main reason cannabis remains illegal is because lobbyists are making tons of money off of prohibition. For example, Pharmaceutical companies lobby against cannabis because at a lower price, there are so many drugs (painkillers, sleep medication) it could replace. Another group that benefits greatly from prohibition are the drug cartels. Legalize marijuana and you cut a huge percent of their profits, army strength, and political power. Otherwise they're going to do whatever they can to save the marijuana black market.
 You could argue that marijuana is physically unhealthy for you and that's why it's illegal. But then you'd have to explain why alcohol and tobacco are legal because those substances are way more harmful than cannabis. 79,000 people a year die from alcohol poisoning, while zero people have died from overdosing on pot. People think that prohibition has kept marijuana out of children's hands. They think legalizing this drug would expose more children and teens to it. It's a whole lot easier for kids to obtain marijuana as opposed to alcohol or tobacco. A drug dealer doesn't check for ID like a cashier would. Teens are susceptible to harsher drugs after trying marijuana because they are introduced to these hardcore drugs in the same underground market where they got the marijuana, not because it's a gateway drug. Another thing that is often said is that marijuana is addictive and can be abused, thus making it mentally unhealthy. This is an unfair statement, anything has the potential to be abused, even something as simple as food. 
 You never hear about the positive effects marijuana can have on society. Many musicians admit that cannabis helps them get creative with their music and opens their minds to new ideas and concepts. Many cancer patients have used medical marijuana as a way of dealing with nausea after treatment or stimulating their appetite. The point is people have benefited from marijuana whether it was for medical or recreational purposes. Cannabis is classified as a schedule one drug, this suggests that it is as dangerous and addictive as heroin, meth, and even more dangerous than cocaine. Even if you believe that's accurate information, who are you to tell people what they can and can't put in their bodies? Expecting everyone to adapt to your beliefs or morals is extremely narrowed minded.
";"The truth about cannabis is that it is a complex and controversial topic. It has been used for centuries for medicinal and recreational purposes, and its effects on the human body are still being studied. Cannabis is a plant that contains over 400 chemical compounds, many of which have been found to have therapeutic effects. It is also known to have psychoactive effects, which can lead to altered states of consciousness and changes in behavior.
 
 The most common active ingredient in cannabis is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). THC is responsible for the psychoactive effects of cannabis, and it is the main component of marijuana. THC is known to have a range of effects on the body, including pain relief, relaxation, and euphoria. It can also cause anxiety, paranoia, and other mental health issues.
 
 Cannabis has been used for medicinal purposes for centuries. It has been used to treat a variety of conditions, including chronic pain, nausea, and seizures. It has also been used to help with anxiety, depression, and insomnia. However, there is still much debate about the safety and efficacy of cannabis for medical use.
 
 The recreational use of cannabis is also controversial. While some people believe that it can be used safely and responsibly, others argue that it can lead to addiction and other negative consequences. There is also evidence that suggests that cannabis use can lead to impaired driving and other dangerous behaviors.
 
 Overall, the truth about cannabis is that it is a complex and controversial topic. It has been used for centuries for medicinal and recreational purposes, and its effects on the human body are still being studied. While there are potential benefits to its use, there are also risks that must be considered. It is important to understand the facts about cannabis before making any decisions about its use.";"The debate surrounding cannabis use and its many potential benefits has been ongoing for decades. Recently, some of the tide has been turning with more states legalizing cannabis use for adults and some even allowing for medical uses. Despite the growing acceptance of cannabis, there are still controversial facts about the plant that often go ignored. In order to understand the truth about cannabis, it is important to look at the evidence surrounding its effects and potential benefits.
 
 One of the most important aspects of cannabis use is the potential for addiction. While most people associate addiction with using hard drugs like heroin or cocaine, cannabis can also be very addictive. Studies have shown that long-term users of the plant can develop a psychological dependence on it, leading to withdrawal symptoms when they try to stop using. This is why it is important to understand the risks of cannabis use and be aware of ones own personal tolerance to the drug. 
 
 Cannabis has also been linked to mental health problems, particularly in users who begin using the drug at an early age. One study found that regular cannabis use during adolescence was associated with a higher risk of depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia. Though this does not mean that cannabis causes these mental health issues, it is an important consideration for those who choose to use the drug.
 
 The truth about cannabis also looks at the potential benefits of the plant. Studies have suggested that cannabis can be beneficial for treating chronic pain, as well as helping to reduce seizures in those with certain disorders. In addition, cannabis has been found to provide relief from nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy treatments. There is also evidence to suggest that cannabis has anti-inflammatory and anti-anxiety properties, which could prove beneficial to those suffering from conditions such as arthritis and PTSD.
 
 The truth is that cannabis can have both positive and negative effects, depending on how it is used and the individuals circumstances. It is important to be aware of the potential risks, as well as the potential benefits, of using cannabis. Before making any decisions about using cannabis, it is important to speak with a medical professional to ensure that it is the right choice for an individuals specific situation.";24;3523;1865;2351;2108.0
9;essay10.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/persuasive-essay-same-sex-marriage-non-issue-essay-39280/;The Non-Issue of Same Sex Marriage;"There is not a single piece of history that determines whether or not same sex marriage is right or wrong. There is absolutely no legal, logical, or governing reason that same sex couples cannot be wed and it's extremely unconstitutional in every way to tell them they can't. Same sex marriage should be legal for a number of reasons, a few being, it's no one else's business if two men or two women want to get married, not allowing them to marry makes them seem inferior, and it rids them of their civil rights.
 In the book Gay marriage by Kate Burns, it states ""Who owns marriage? In other words, who defines marriage? Who allows marriage, and who enforces it?"" (22) It's wrong to tell two people who love each other that they cannot marry; it's nobody's business who you fall in love with. Just like it is no one's business to tell same sex couples they should not be able wed. Same sex couples just want the benefits of being married like everyone else and there is no proof saying that it is wrong for them to have those benefits. By not allowing them to marry all that America is doing is depriving same sex couples of their rights to care for each other and provide for each other. A common married couple gets benefits on health, gets to make decisions that are best for their spouse in extreme cases, and gets to inherit their spouse's belongings in death. 
 Making same sex marriage illegal also makes the people who are attracted to the same sex feel inferior. Nobody likes feeling inferior, or like they a below standards, by making sex marriage illegal you are making people who are attracted to the same sex feel and seem inferior to others. Homosexuality is not a conscious choice; it's something they are born with. Just like you didn't choose who you love, neither did they. So it's unfair to make same sex marriage seem inferior when it is no different. In the book Historical Guides to Controversial Issues in America Same-Sex Marriage by Allene Phy-Olsen it states ""Recent decades have seen much interest in the idea of diversity. The argument for same sex marriage asserts that it is hypocritical to deny the full rights and opportunities of citizenship which includes the access to an institution as basic as matrimony"" (76) You would never make a women feel inferior for being a women, so why should you make a man or a women feel like they are less just based on who they love. 
 Same sex marriage being illegal rids the couple of their civil rights. Civil rights are something people have worked hard to maintain over the years, abolishing slavery and treating women equally. Homosexual couples are no different. They deserve to have their civil rights fulfilled, just like women deserve to vote, they should be allowed to get married. Majority of the population against same sex marriage firmly believe the bible states that it is unholy for couples of the same gender to marry. Many people think that the word of the bible is comparable to law; however we have an amendment which protects our country from that exact situation. In the book The Constitution of the United States of America The Bicentennial keepsake edition, the first amendment provides that ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ...."" (51) The fact that it's in the bible should not dictate the laws against same sex couples becoming wed. Not allowing same sex couples to marry is like saying all people born with a certain hair color should not be allowed marry people of other hair colors, It makes no sense. Laws have been changed for all sexes, races' and genders for the same purpose, equal rights. It is hypocritical to not allow same sex marriage to occur when it appeals to a large growing group of people. 
 In the end same sex couples are really just couples and should be treated as such. They should be allowed the benefits of marriage, treated equally, not like they are inferior, and same sex couples should be allowed their civil rights. One day in the future this will be achieved.";"Same sex marriage has been a controversial topic for many years, but it is not an issue that should be debated. Same sex marriage is a human right that should be granted to all individuals regardless of their sexual orientation.
 
 The right to marry is a fundamental human right that should be granted to all individuals. This right is enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that men and women of full age, without any limitation due to race, nationality or religion, have the right to marry and to found a family. This right should be extended to all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation.
 
 The argument against same sex marriage is often based on religious beliefs. However, the right to marry should not be determined by religious beliefs. Marriage is a civil right, not a religious one. The government should not be in the business of deciding who can and cannot marry based on religious beliefs.
 
 The argument against same sex marriage is also often based on the belief that it is unnatural or unacceptable. However, same sex relationships have been documented throughout history and in many cultures. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that same sex relationships are unnatural or unacceptable.
 
 The right to marry is a fundamental human right that should be granted to all individuals. Same sex marriage is not an issue that should be debated. It is a human right that should be granted to all individuals regardless of their sexual orientation.";"The issue of same sex marriage is one that has been hotly debated for years, but it is not an issue at all. The Supreme Court ruled in 2015 that same sex couples have the right to marry in every state in the union, regardless of religious or cultural beliefs. This ruling provided the legal basis for marriage equality in the United States and declared that members of the LGBTQ community have the same right to marry that heterosexual couples do. Thus, same sex marriage is no longer a non-issue.
 
 The reasons why same sex marriage is not an issue are myriad. For one, numerous polls in the United States and around the world show that support for same sex marriage continues to grow. In the United States, polls have consistently shown that a majority of people now support same sex marriage, including a majority of young people. This suggests that the majority of people in the United States no longer oppose same sex marriage.
 
 Second, there is no longer any legitimate legal argument to be made against same sex marriage. The Supreme Court's ruling provided the legal foundation for marriage equality, and any attempts to argue against same sex marriages are likely to be dismissed. This legal precedent has essentially rendered the issue moot, and marriage equality is now the law of the land.
 
 Finally, same sex marriage is no longer a non-issue because it is no longer a divisive political issue. In the past, politicians of both parties used same sex marriage as a wedge issue to attract voters, but this is no longer the case. The majority of Americans now support marriage equality, and this level of support has made same sex marriage a non-issue in American politics.
 
 In conclusion, same sex marriage is no longer an issue. The Supreme Court has provided the legal foundation for marriage equality, and societal attitudes towards same sex marriage have shifted significantly in recent years. As a result, same sex marriage is no longer a political issue, and is now accepted by a majority of Americans. Therefore, same sex marriage is no longer a non-issue.";34;4065;1511;2080;1795.5
10;essay11.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/arguementative-persuasive-essay-camping-9834/;Everyone Should Go Camping;"Camping can take on many definitions. Camping to one person can mean seclusion in the middle of a forest. Another individual might think camping as a motor home with all the amenities of their house, including the kitchen sink. Whatever the definition is, camping is an experience that should be tried by everyone.
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has posted on their website, http://www.epa.gov/iaq/pubs/insidest.html, that approximately 90% of a person's life is spent indoors. The same article goes on to state ""In the last several years, a growing body of scientific evidence has indicated that the air within homes and other buildings can be more seriously polluted than the outdoor air in even the largest and most industrialized cities."" Spending time camping is a great way to revitalize the lungs. The phrase ""city air"" often is thought as air that is polluted, while ""country air"" is often used to describe clean, healthy air. Breathing the country air usually makes a person feel revitalized. There is no better way to receive the country air than while camping.
 Another great part about camping is being outside under the sun. The sun rays help the human body with the production of vitamin D. In fact, other than popping a vitamin pill, the only way that a body can produce vitamin D is through the exposure to the sun. Feeling the warm rays of the sun hit the face is always a welcome sensation. Being outside in the sun is another great advantage of camping.
 With the recent downturn of the economy, people are always trying to find ways to have fun at a relative inexpensive cost. Camping is a great way to have fun while keeping the overall cost down. A one night stay at Sands of Time RV Park costs twenty two dollars a night. That fee includes water, sewer, and electric. A stay in a condo in the same area will cost at least $645.00 for the week. A condo will cost the family $491 more than a campsite. That difference in price can make a camping trip a good possibility while keeping the overall costs down to a minimum.
 Camping gives anyone the possibility to go places that they have never been before. Camping can take you to Yosemite, or into the Band Lands of South Dakota. Camping can also take place at a nearby state park. No matter where the campsite is, a camper can feel miles away from the city. There are so many places both near and far that are best experienced by spending a few days within the place. Camping gives you the ability to see these beautiful locations at first sunlight, in the middle of the day, at sunset and even under the stars. It can be amazing how different the same object can look throughout the day.
 Campers often express how a feeling comes over their body when they reach the moment when the day to day turmoil leaves their body. Virtually every camper experiences this moment. This is specifically when they are experiencing nature and the realization is made how much simpler life is when outside with nature. Returning to nature often allows campers to return to their true selves. It is this discovery that should be experienced by all.
 The benefits of camping can also be seen in families. Some people that do not like the idea of camping give the reason of having to camp with people in such a confined space. It this confined space that, when allowed, can create a close bond between family members. When families go camping, they put the jobs and sporting events on hold. There are usually no video games being played, no soccer practice to drive to, and no business projects to worry about. By putting aside all of these events, the family has an opportunity to bond and renew their relationships. Some of this may be foreign to some people and there can be resistance. When this resistance is put aside, these bonds will be renewed. Camping is a great way to bring families together and strengthen their love.
 Food is always a item that people cannot do without. Campers have an opportunity to try some interesting food. Cooking over a fire makes burgers and potatoes taste better than can be found at any fast food place. Campers need to think out their meals thoroughly prior to making a trip. These well planned meals are sometimes the best meals that campers have ever had. Cooking a chicken over campfire, cooking an apple pie in a dutch oven, and cooking a burger wrapped in foil on the coals of a camp fire can put the best gourmet chefs to shame. Perhaps it is the fresh smoke, the clean air or just the fact that a camper's senses are heightened. Whatever the reasons are, food always tastes better when camping.
 Some of the people that can be met while camping can make the entire trip better. Campers can come from every state, and sometimes different countries. Taking a simple walk around the campsite, the camper can encounter these people and hear the most amazing stories. Campers are friendly and enjoy the company of fellow campers. Kids always seem to find new ""best friends"" for the weekends and even adults may find themselves sharing a meal with their new neighbors.
 Sometimes camping can also make campers realize the overlooked luxuries that they experience day to day. Flush toilets, warm showers, central heating and air, and even the lack of bugs accompanying the sleeping camper are some of the luxuries that are missed the most. A small weekend away from these luxuries can make the campers realize how lucky they are in their day to day living.
 Camping is one of the most basic and enjoyable activities that can be experienced by all. Camping has no requirements other than willing participants. Camping doesn't discriminate, doesn't have deadlines and has nothing but fun around each corner. No matter if the camping is experienced in a tent or in a luxury camper, getting outside, in the wilderness can provide a lifetime of memories. Camping has something for everyone.";"Camping is an activity that has been around for centuries, and it is an activity that everyone should experience at least once in their lifetime. Camping is a great way to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life and to reconnect with nature. It is a chance to explore the outdoors, to learn new skills, and to bond with family and friends.
 
 Camping is a great way to get away from the stresses of everyday life and to relax. When camping, you can take a break from the hectic pace of life and enjoy the peace and quiet of nature. You can take a break from technology and the constant bombardment of information and just enjoy the beauty of the outdoors. Camping is a great way to unplug and to spend quality time with family and friends.
 
 Camping is also a great way to learn new skills. When camping, you can learn how to build a fire, how to cook over an open flame, and how to navigate the wilderness. You can also learn how to identify different plants and animals, and how to be safe in the outdoors. Camping is a great way to build self-confidence and to learn new skills.
 
 Camping is also a great way to bond with family and friends. When camping, you can spend quality time with your loved ones, away from the distractions of everyday life. You can share stories, play games, and just enjoy each others company. Camping is a great way to create lasting memories with your family and friends.
 
 In conclusion, camping is an activity that everyone should experience at least once in their lifetime. It is a great way to get away from the stresses of everyday life, to learn new skills, and to bond with family and friends. Camping is an activity that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and backgrounds, and it is an activity that can create lasting memories.";"Camping is a great outdoor activity that can create wonderful memories for all ages. Everyone should, at some point in their life, go camping for a variety of reasons. 
 
 First, camping is a great way to disconnect from technology and the day-to-day hustle and bustle of life. In todays world, we are consumed by technology and it is easy to become overwhelmed by our cell phones, computers, and other devices. Taking a break from technology can be beneficial and camping can be the perfect way to do that.
 
 When camping, you are also forced to be in nature, which comes with its own set of benefits. Studies have shown that even brief exposure to nature can have a positive effect on mental and physical health. Being in nature can help you relax and reset your mind, enabling you to return to the stresses of the real world refreshed and ready to tackle any challenge.
 
 Another positive of camping is the ability to bond with family and friends. Whether its cooking together, exploring the area, or simply sitting around a campfire, camping can be a great way to create memories and strengthen relationships. It can also be a great opportunity for children to learn about nature and the outdoors.
 
 Finally, camping can be an affordable adventure. From tent camping to renting an RV, there are plenty of options available to fit any budget. With the money you save on lodging, you could opt for any number of exciting activities or even splurge on gourmet camping meals.
 
 In conclusion, camping is a wonderful outdoor activity that everyone should experience at least once in their lifetime. Its a great way to disconnect from technology and get back to nature, while also providing an affordable adventure and opportunity to bond with family and friends.";26;5892;1786;1765;1775.5

Why do many students oppose locker checks? Random locker checks are not done to torment and/or invade the privacy of the students, but for many other important reasons which include school security. These checks are required because malicious students bring drugs and weapons to school and store them in the lockers. Random locker checks should be made obligatory and done frequently to assure the wellbeing of the students.
 In the first place, locker checks help increase the safety in schools. Safety is a problem in every environment and especially school. Drugs, alcohol, and firearms in lockers make a harmless place like school quite dangerous. School was known to be a secure environment for children where they could learn and have a have a fun time with friends. In the past 10 years that has all changed. The number of school shootings has increased significantly. Last year on April 16th the most deadly school shooting in U.S. history occurred. In this brutal massacre at Virginia Tech, 32 students were murdered and several more were wounded. To combat this growing epidemic, schools carry out repeated locker checks. 
 In the second place, locker checks keep students healthy. Locker checks help students stay both physically and mentally healthy because it discourages students from bringing fire arms and especially drugs. As everyone knows, drugs induce immense physical damage and when it is overdosed drugs can lead to death. As a result, drugs completely destroy a student's life. To prevent problems like this locker checks are required. Without the use of drugs, school security will increase dramatically. If the school is safe, students will no be frightened or strained.
 Lastly, more students will comply with the school policies because there are frequent locker checks and other students are getting caught and punished for it. The students who are yet to be caught will learn from the mistakes of other students and will stop. To increase the effect of locker checks, they should be done with security guards and dogs. Security guards at school increase security and security dogs help find drugs with their noses. School is a place to learn, not a place to bring malicious substances, electronics and etc. So, only learning material should be brought to school. With the continued discouraging of bringing drugs and weapons, a completely secure school will become an accomplishable goal.
 Locker checks should be made mandatory and done frequently because they assure security in schools, makes students healthy, and will make students obey school policies in the future. Students should	appreciate locker checks and other measures taken by the school to protect the school and the students. Privacy is a small price to pay for security against drugs and weapons. Like it or not, privacy will be invaded not only at school, so students have to accept it.";"Locker checks are a common practice in many schools across the country. The purpose of locker checks is to ensure the safety of students and staff, as well as to maintain order and discipline in the school. While locker checks can be a useful tool for school administrators, there are also some potential drawbacks that should be considered.
 
 The primary benefit of locker checks is that they can help to reduce the risk of weapons and other dangerous items being brought into the school. By searching lockers, school administrators can ensure that students are not bringing any items that could be used to harm themselves or others. Additionally, locker checks can help to deter students from bringing illegal items to school, such as drugs or alcohol.
 
 However, there are also some potential drawbacks to locker checks. For one, locker checks can be seen as an invasion of privacy. Students may feel that their lockers are their own personal space, and that searching them is a violation of their rights. Additionally, locker checks can be time consuming and costly for school administrators.
 
 In conclusion, locker checks can be a useful tool for school administrators to ensure the safety of students and staff, as well as to maintain order and discipline in the school. However, there are also some potential drawbacks that should be considered, such as the potential invasion of privacy and the cost and time associated with locker checks. Ultimately, it is up to school administrators to decide if locker checks are an appropriate measure for their school.";"Locker checks are an effective tool in the fight against school violence and the proliferation of weapons and illegal substances in educational institutions. The goal of locker checks is to deter students from bringing prohibited items and substances onto school grounds, ensuring that schools are safe and secure learning environments.
 
 Locker checks allow school personnel to inspect the contents of lockers for weapons, drugs, and other contraband. School administrators and security personnel have the authority to search student lockers in order to ensure that prohibited items are not being concealed. These checks are done randomly, or in response to a specific suspicion of criminal activity.
 
 The legal basis for school searches is grounded in the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. This amendment protects citizens from unreasonable searches and seizures by the government and requires that searches are conducted in a reasonable manner. As long as school administrators conduct locker checks in accordance with the law, the U.S. Supreme Court has found that schools may constitutionally search lockers without having probable cause or obtaining a search warrant.
 
 However, the legal basis of locker checks only accounts for part of the equation. It is not enough for school administrations to simply possess the power to search student lockers. They must also take measures to ensure that the searches are conducted with respect for student privacy and dignity.
 
 At a minimum, schools should provide students with clear information about the locker check policy and the potential consequences of being found in possession of contraband. Students should be informed of the rules and where they can find additional information. In addition, any searches should be conducted with respect and in a manner that does not disrupt the learning environment.
 
 Furthermore, the checks should be done in a manner that is consistent with the law and that does not violate the rights of the students. For example, if a student locker contains multiple items, school officials must have reasonable suspicion to search through each and every item. Otherwise, any evidence obtained can be deemed inadmissible in court.
 
 Overall, locker checks are an important tool in preventing school violence and ensuring the safety of students and staff. When done correctly, they can be effective in helping to deter students from bringing prohibited items onto school grounds and can be a critical part of establishing secure and safe learning environments.";13;2925;1569;2560;2064.5
12;essay13.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/computers-replace-man-powr-jobs-3591/;Computer replace  man power in jobs;"With the current trend today of the ever-changing technology, it cannot be denied that several jobs are replaceable. On the other hand, there are still jobs which require the expertise of a human employee especially when it entails decision-making situations. 
 One example of a job that got replaced by the availability of technology or computer to the public is the reservation and ticketing officers of travel agencies and airlines. You can now see the availability of your intended travel dates online, make the reservation, know the price of the ticket you want to purchase and pay conveniently with your credit card and you're all done. You even have the choice of printing your own ticket or just pick it up at the airport at the day of your departure. But of course, there would still be several customers that prefer to talk with an agent in completing their purchase of a ticket. They may have several reasons to it but then maybe they are just comfortable dealing with a human being than a computer.
 Jobs that the most computer can do is assist, would be that of a medical doctor. It's true that technology and computers do make their jobs easier but it cannot definitely replace them. It can have less work for them, just for instance, instead of opening up a patient to get a gallstone, they would just use an instrument that would make a point incision and guide it through inside the body to do the job for them.
 With this, i still believe that technology and computers cannot eventually replace the workforce and drive employees to be jobless. We still need the personal touch of a human in each and everything that technology or computer could offer us.";"In recent years, the use of computers in the workplace has become increasingly commonplace. As technology continues to advance, computers are being used to replace human labor in a variety of jobs. This trend has been met with both enthusiasm and apprehension, as some people worry that computers will eventually replace humans in the workforce.
 
 The most obvious benefit of computers replacing human labor is the cost savings. Computers are much cheaper to maintain than human employees, and they can often perform tasks more quickly and accurately. This can lead to increased efficiency and productivity in the workplace, as well as cost savings for employers. Additionally, computers can be programmed to do tasks that would be too difficult or time consuming for humans to do. This can lead to increased accuracy and consistency in the workplace, as well as the ability to complete tasks that would otherwise be impossible.
 
 However, there are also some drawbacks to computers replacing human labor. For one, computers lack the creativity and problem-solving skills of humans. This can lead to a decrease in innovation in the workplace, as computers are unable to come up with new ideas or solutions to problems. Additionally, computers can be prone to errors and malfunctions, which can lead to costly delays and mistakes. Finally, computers can also lead to job losses, as human employees are replaced by machines.
 
 Overall, the use of computers to replace human labor in the workplace has both benefits and drawbacks. While computers can lead to cost savings and increased efficiency, they can also lead to job losses and a decrease in innovation. Ultimately, the decision to use computers to replace human labor should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the specific needs of the workplace.";"The rapid advancement of technology has had a tremendous impact on the world of work. In recent years, computer technology has had a significant impact on job roles and opportunities, with many jobs that once required physical labor now being replaced by machines or computers. According to a study conducted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the impact of automation on the labor market could reach 47% by 2030. This has led to concerns about the increasing replacement of human work by machines. In this essay, I will discuss how computer replace man power in jobs, both in terms of the risks and opportunities that this presents.
 
 The first and most obvious risk of computer replacing man power in jobs is job losses. As technology evolves, robots and computers become increasingly capable of performing complex tasks that used to require human labor. This means that jobs like manufacturing, warehousing and administrative tasks are increasingly being automated with computer systems. This is particularly true in the industrial sector, where automation has resulted in large numbers of job losses. Furthermore, with the development of artificial intelligence (AI), more human-like tasks such as customer service, online marketing and sales will also be at risk of being replaced by computer systems.
 
 However, automating jobs with computer systems also presents a number of opportunities. Automation is usually faster and more efficient than manual labor, meaning that a large number of tasks can be done more quickly and at a lower cost. This means that businesses can become more competitive and efficient, resulting in lower prices and improved customer service. Furthermore, automation also reduces the need for physical labor, which can increase workplace safety and reduce the risk of occupational illness. Additionally, automation can free up employees to perform more creative and engaging tasks, such as problem solving and customer interaction.
 
 In conclusion, the use of computer systems to automate jobs presents both risks and opportunities. Automation can lead to job losses, but also offers the opportunity to increase efficiency and reduce costs. Furthermore, it can free up employees to perform more creative and rewarding tasks. Ultimately, it is important to ensure that computer systems are used responsibly, in order to create a safe, productive and fulfilling work environment.";35;1672;1822;2446;2134.0
13;essay14.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/essay-lessons-teachers-versus-others-sources-6343/;Lessons with teachers versus others sources;"Over the last half century the change in the life of human begings has increased beyond our wildest expectations. There are countless new technological equipments flooding into our lives, such as the Internet, television and cell phone. They all enrich our daily lives.Now, many students learn from Internet after class and they find it quite helpful.
 Many people find that students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers. They argue that teachers teach students how to write, read and calculate since they are in kindergarten.And when they are in primary school, teachers teach them more further knowledge, like writing skills and using computers.It is teachers that help them with obstacles in schooling. On the other hand, students gain most of the knowledge through teachers and learn what is right and wrong with the assistance of teachers.
 Those who feel that students learn far more from other sources, such as the Internet and television, frimly believe that within this sources students learn lots of things which they can't learn in classes. They can only input some key words and google it, and then there are numberless articles and websites related to it. In this case, stundents learn things easily. Moreover, they contend that good television programmes do teach students.For instance, Discovery Channel has many instructive episodes. Students have knowledge of others cultrues, outer space etc.
 Personally, I think that students learn far more from their teachers than from other source. Because not only do teachers teach us knowlegde but also the skills to tell right from wrong. Just imagine: if a student can't even make out whether the source is reasonable or not , then how can he get the right information to help him to learn?";"Teachers have long been the primary source of knowledge for students, but in recent years, other sources of information have become increasingly available. This has led to a debate about whether teachers are still the best source of knowledge, or if other sources are more effective. This essay will explore the advantages and disadvantages of learning from teachers versus other sources, and ultimately argue that teachers are still the best source of knowledge.
 
 One of the main advantages of learning from teachers is that they are experts in their field. Teachers have typically studied their subject for many years and have a deep understanding of the material. This means that they can provide students with a comprehensive overview of the subject, as well as detailed explanations of difficult concepts. Furthermore, teachers are able to provide students with personalized feedback and guidance, which can be invaluable for students who are struggling with a particular topic.
 
 On the other hand, other sources of information can also be beneficial for students. For example, the internet provides students with access to a wealth of information, including articles, videos, and other resources. This can be especially helpful for students who are looking for a more in-depth understanding of a particular topic. Additionally, other sources can provide students with a different perspective on a subject, which can be beneficial for those who are looking for a more holistic view of the material.
 
 Ultimately, it is clear that both teachers and other sources of information can be beneficial for students. However, teachers are still the best source of knowledge. This is because teachers are experts in their field and can provide students with a comprehensive overview of the subject. Additionally, teachers are able to provide personalized feedback and guidance, which can be invaluable for students who are struggling with a particular topic. For these reasons, it is clear that teachers are still the best source of knowledge.";"Teachers have been a source of knowledge since the dawn of history. In the centuries that have followed, the emphasis on teachers has remained an integral part of the education system, with teachers providing guidance, instruction and mentoring to their students. But in the last decade, the emergence of technology, the increased availability of online resources, and the increasing prevalence of independent learning opportunities has created a debate as to whether teachers are still the best source of learning for students.
 
 On one hand, there is little doubt that teachers can provide a great wealth of knowledge, particularly for those students who seek it. Teachers bring a level of expertise and experience to the classroom that sets them far above other sources. They have a deep understanding of their subject matter as well as a deep understanding of their students. Furthermore, they are able to provide personalized guidance and instruction that can help students to not only master the material, but to develop their academic and life skills.
 
 On the other hand, there are many other sources of knowledge available to students. Nowadays, students can access a wealth of knowledge via the internet, with an entire world of information right at their fingertips. Through websites, online classes, and discussion boards, students can learn a great deal while having greater freedom as to when and how they learn. Additionally, independent mentors such as family members and friends can provide just as much knowledge and mentoring as teachers, often sharing their own experiences and perspectives with students.
 
 At the end of the day, it is up to the individual student to find the best source of learning that fits their needs. While teachers remain a primary source of knowledge for many students, especially in traditional educational settings, the emergence of non-traditional resources and independent learning opportunities cannot be ignored. Ultimately, it is up to the student to determine the best mixture of resources to help them learn and reach their academic and life goals.";43;1791;2044;2106;2075.0
14;essay15.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/writing-email-text-messaging-threats-written-language-6551/;Email and text messaging threats written language;"The introduction of email and text messaging has brought about considerable changes in communication. With this situation, some people believe that they may be factors decreasing the position of written language. I am in favor of that idea because of their advantages and the fact we can see today about the use of these new means.
 First of all, it is easy to point out many benefits users can get from email and text messaging, which answers to the question of their great popularity. Before email and mobile phone, human beings communicated by meeting directly, sending letters or later, calling from home phones. Such ways usually made people have troubles for the expensiveness, difficulties in far communication or emergency and the loss of information. However, email and cell phones have improved the obstacles above. People can send or receive electronic letters anywhere and anytime they want. Especially, thanks to the function provided by email and text messaging (SMS), it is cheaper and faster to transfer a lot of information, even to many people at the same time. They are so convenient that the majority of population prefer to use them instead of some traditional ways.
 The popularity of email and text messaging, as a result, leads to the losing of written language's position. People tend to use slangs and abbreviated words to shorten their writing and save more time in communicating for other activities. The outcome is that language in writing is not in its original form. Even in some cases, people compose a message with only emoticons (the expressions by face created by service providers), which means there is no room for writing or typing texts. Moreover, it is more dangerous that youngsters sometimes use such new languages in their studying, writing assignments. If that tendency continues at a rapid pace, written language may face up to a real problem about its stand.
 In conclusion, we cannot deny the threat from email and text messaging to the status of written language because their obvious popularity. Nevertheless, educators and individuals themselves, especially the youths should pay ore attention to this matter so that we can take advantages of the new language along with preserving the traditional one.";"Email and text messaging have become the primary means of communication in the modern world. They have revolutionized the way we communicate, allowing us to stay in touch with friends, family, and colleagues from anywhere in the world. However, with this increased convenience comes the potential for abuse. Email and text messaging threats are a growing problem, and they can have serious consequences.
 
 Email and text messaging threats can take many forms. They can be direct threats of violence or intimidation, or they can be more subtle, such as attempts to manipulate or control someone. In some cases, the threats may be made anonymously, making it difficult to identify the sender. In other cases, the sender may be known, but the recipient may be unaware of the senders identity.
 
 The consequences of email and text messaging threats can be serious. Victims may experience fear, anxiety, and depression. They may also suffer physical harm if the threats are carried out. In some cases, the threats may be used to extort money or other items of value.
 
 The best way to protect yourself from email and text messaging threats is to be aware of the potential risks. Be sure to use strong passwords and two-factor authentication to protect your accounts. If you receive a threatening message, do not respond. Instead, report it to the police or other appropriate authorities.
 
 It is also important to be aware of the laws surrounding email and text messaging threats. In many countries, it is illegal to send threatening messages. If you are the victim of a threat, you may be able to take legal action against the sender.
 
 In conclusion, email and text messaging threats are a growing problem. They can have serious consequences for victims, and it is important to be aware of the potential risks. By taking steps to protect yourself and understanding the laws surrounding these threats, you can help to reduce the risk of becoming a victim.";"The use of written language has come a long way since the invention of the printing press. Today, email and text messaging offer quick and easy ways to communicate with people, but they also bring with them the threat of cyberbullying and other forms of harassment. This essay will examine the ways in which these threats can affect written language and what can be done to protect users from them. 
 
 First, it is important to note that the use of email and text messaging has made written language much more accessible to a wider range of people. Not only has this accessibility allowed for more frequent communication and faster responses, it has also opened the door for increased cyberbullying and harassment. Email and text messages can be sent anonymously, making it difficult to trace the source of cyberbullying and difficult to identify and punish perpetrators. This can lead to a hostile work environment, or worse, cyberbullying and harassment of vulnerable individuals who lack the skills to protect themselves. Furthermore, cyberbullying and harassment can take a toll on an individuals mental and emotional well-being, causing anxiety, depression, and even suicidal thoughts. 
 
 To combat the threat of cyberbullying and harassment, it is important to educate users on the potential risks and provide guidance on how to protect themselves. For example, users should be encouraged to limit their contact list to people they know and trust, and should be taught how to identify signs of cyberbullying. Furthermore, users should be encouraged to report any suspicious or malicious behavior they encounter to the proper authorities. Additionally, companies should provide users with tools to control their privacy and security settings, as well as resources to help them if they are the victims of cyberbullying and harassment.
 
 In conclusion, the use of email and text messaging has made written language more accessible, but it has also increased the risk of cyberbullying and harassment. In order to protect users, it is important to educate them on the potential risks and provide guidance on how to protect themselves. Additionally, companies should provide resources to help victims of cyberbullying, as well as tools to control their privacy and security settings. By following these steps, users can better protect themselves from the threats posed by written language.";49;2252;1956;2392;2174.0
15;essay16.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/research-papers-11/essay-useing-animals-benefit-human-beings-6746/;Using animals for the benefit of the human beings;"With the rapid development of the standard of people's life, increasing numbers of animal experiments are done, new medicines and foods, for instance. Some opponents says that it is cruel to animals and nature, however, I believe that no sensible person will deny that it is a dramatically cruel activity to humanity if the latest foods or medicines are allowed to sold without testing on animals. In my essay, I will discuss this issue from twofold aspects.
 First of all, as we all know, animals are friendly and vital for people, because if there are no animals in the world, the balance of nature will broke down, and we, human, will die out as well. The animal experiments accelerate the vanishing of some categories of animals. In other words, doing this various testing is a hazard of human's future and next generation.
 Though animal experiments have negative impact on the natural balance, it is necessary to make sure that people can live a long life. To begin with, it is indisputable that every new kind food or pill may be noxious, and scientists must do something to insure that the new invention benefits people instead of making people ill or even dying. The new foods or medicines are invented to promote the quantity of human's life. Thus even if they are volunteers; they cannot take the place of animals to test the new foods or medicines. Furthermore, it also have potentially harm for human's health without any testing. 
 To sum up, I reaffirm that although there is some disadvantages of animals' profits, the merits of animal experiments still outweigh the demerits.";"Animals have been used for the benefit of human beings for centuries. From providing food and clothing to providing companionship and entertainment, animals have been a part of human life for a long time. In recent years, the use of animals for the benefit of humans has become even more widespread. Animals are now being used in medical research, for therapeutic purposes, and even in the development of new technologies.
 
 The use of animals in medical research has been a controversial topic for many years. Animal testing is used to determine the safety and effectiveness of new drugs and treatments. While animal testing can be cruel and inhumane, it is often necessary in order to ensure the safety of humans. Animal testing has led to the development of many life-saving treatments and medications, and it is an important part of medical research.
 
 Animals are also being used for therapeutic purposes. Animals can provide comfort and companionship to people who are suffering from physical or mental illness. Animal-assisted therapy has been shown to reduce stress and anxiety, and it can even help people with depression and other mental health issues. Animals can also provide physical therapy, helping people with physical disabilities to improve their mobility and strength.
 
 Finally, animals are being used in the development of new technologies. Animals are being used to test the safety of new products, such as cars and medical devices. They are also being used to develop new technologies, such as robots and artificial intelligence. By using animals in these ways, scientists and engineers can ensure that new products are safe and effective before they are released to the public.
 
 Overall, the use of animals for the benefit of human beings is an important part of modern life. Animals can provide food, clothing, companionship, and even medical treatments. They can also be used to develop new technologies and products. While animal testing can be cruel and inhumane, it is often necessary in order to ensure the safety of humans. By using animals responsibly, we can ensure that they are treated humanely and that their contributions to human life are appreciated.";"Humans have been using animals for their own benefit for thousands of years. From providing meat and dairy for nutrition, domestic animals for labor, hunting animals for sport, and the use of animals in medical research, the range of applications of animals to the benefit of humans is broad and diverse. This essay will explore the various ways in which animals are used to benefit humanity, and discuss the ethical implications of such uses.
 
 The most obvious role that animals play in human life is the provision of food. Domestic animals such as cows, pigs, sheep, and chickens provide us with much-needed protein in the form of meat and dairy products. Hunting animals such as deer and other wild game are also a source of meat for many people around the world, and contribute to the subsistence of hunter-gatherers and rural communities.
 
 In addition to providing nutrition, animals can also provide labor. Horses, donkeys, and oxen are examples of animals that are used to pull carts and plough fields, helping humans to move heavy loads or ensure an efficient harvest. Dogs are also used as working animals, and are particularly well known for their roles in guiding the blind and assisting in search and rescue operations.
 
 In many parts of the world, animals are used for recreational hunting and fishing. This contributes to the local economy, as well as providing a source of entertainment and a means of connecting with nature. It is also important to note that animals are frequently used in medical research, particularly in the development of treatments and cures for human diseases.
 
 Despite the numerous benefits that humans can gain from animals, there are also some ethical considerations to take into account. In particular, animal rights activists have highlighted the potential for cruelty and suffering when animals are used for food, labor, and research. To the extent possible, these issues should be addressed through laws, regulations, and changes to industry practices.
 
 In conclusion, while animals have played a major role in the progress of human civilization, it is also important to recognize the ethical implications of their use. As such, humans should strive to ensure that the uses of animals for their own benefit are conducted in a humane and respectful manner, so as to prevent unnecessary suffering and promote animal welfare.";49;1592;2194;2378;2286.0
16;essay17.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/should-rich-countries-help-poor-countries-51532/;Should rich countries help poor countries?;"Nowadays, the world includes developing countries and developed countries. The difference between them is amount of money that governments use in critical areas such as commerce, health, education. The poor countries are buried in debts which are caused by loans they borrowed from The World Bank and the rich countries. To ease this difference and help the less fortune countries, the richer countries should take efforts in improving important areas in the less fortune countries. 
 Most of the people in African and poor countries live in difficult conditions because of their countries locate in areas where lack of natural resources and have bad weather conditions for development as well. In these countries, citizens are in need for foods, corrupt and unemployment rate is at high level, the consequences of AIDS are devastating quickly. These problems will be dealt with if the richer countries agree to help by donating free drugs for the inflected population, sending doctors and nurses to treat and educate those in need, teaching the inflected citizens how to prevent this disease spread. 
 Furthermore, most economies of developing countries depends on exporting raw material and agricultural products as rice, corn. Then, they buy industrialized products from developed countries which result in financial deficit. This made poor countries have to borrow significant amount of money from World Bank which they can not repay even interest. Sometimes, the money disappears without any impact. Regarding to this issue, the G8 which include eight richest countries decided to forgive billions of dollars in debts owned by poor countries. 
 In conclusion, the rich countries play an important role in helping poor countries develop important areas such as trade, health and education. Besides rely on helps from rich countries, poor countries should take efforts by themselves.";"The world today is a global village, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore the plight of the less fortunate. Rich countries have a responsibility to help poor countries, as it is the only way to ensure a more equitable and prosperous future for all.
 
 The most obvious way in which rich countries can help poor countries is through financial aid. This can be done in the form of grants, loans, and other forms of assistance. This money can be used to fund development projects, such as infrastructure, education, and health care. It can also be used to help alleviate poverty, by providing food, clean water, and other basic necessities. In addition, financial aid can be used to help countries build their economies, by providing access to markets and technology.
 
 In addition to financial aid, rich countries can also help poor countries by providing technical assistance. This can include providing expertise in areas such as agriculture, health care, and education. It can also include providing access to technology, which can help countries develop their economies and improve their standard of living.
 
 Finally, rich countries can help poor countries by advocating for their rights. This can include speaking out against human rights abuses, advocating for fairer trade agreements, and pushing for more equitable access to resources. It can also include providing support for international organizations, such as the United Nations, which are working to promote peace and justice around the world.
 
 In conclusion, it is clear that rich countries have a responsibility to help poor countries. By providing financial aid, technical assistance, and advocating for their rights, rich countries can help ensure a more equitable and prosperous future for all.";"In todays globalized world, wealth inequality between countries is deeply entrenched, with rich countries often possessing far more resources than their poorer counterparts. A significant part of this disparity is due to underdeveloped infrastructure, lack of resources, and lack of access to basic necessities in poorer countries. As a result, the question arises of whether rich countries should help poor countries.
 
 The answer is yes. Rich countries have an opportunity, and indeed a moral responsibility, to step in and help alleviate some of the extreme poverty found in poorer countries. This does not mean simply providing short-term aid, but rather involves taking steps to empower struggling economies so as to create long-term, sustainable development. This can involve providing financial aid, investing in basic infrastructure, and providing resources to help advance educational and healthcare initiatives.
 
 Rich countries are in a unique position to provide the resources necessary to help alleviate poverty in poorer countries. They can provide financial aid and technical assistance to support the development of necessary infrastructure, such as roads and communication networks. They can also facilitate investments in small businesses and aid in the development of education, healthcare, and agricultural programs.
 
 In addition to providing aid and resources, rich countries can also assist in the development of international governing structures that promote financial stability and economic opportunity. Rich countries can work together to develop policies that reduce barriers to trade and investment and promote economic growth. This will create the conditions necessary for long-term, sustainable development.
 
 It is clear that rich countries can play an important role in helping to reduce poverty in poorer countries. Through providing resources, investing in infrastructure, and establishing governing structures that promote economic opportunity, rich countries can help to improve the lives of those living in poverty. As a result, all countries should prioritize extending a helping hand to their underdeveloped counterparts.";42;1886;1781;2165;1973.0
17;essay18.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/gender-equality-uni-admission-6913/;Gender Equality at university admission;"Nowadays men and women are equally participating in every field. Contrastingly, in the past time, women worked at home and performed sophisticated work. This factor is still affecting thinking of many people. They still believe that in present time women must do such type of work only. This tendency enforces universities to accept student according to the gender.
 Universities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders. Initially, if we look into the fact, women have proved themselves in every field whether it is indoor or outdoor. For example, nowadays women are working in home as well as in the sky. They are acting as a good housewife and they are flying planes also. Furthermore, university authority must not be biased on ground of the gender discrimination. They must consider the academic record of the student as main criteria of admission. 
 However, the current job market affects the decision of universities. Every university designs its courses according to the need of employers. The job selection criteria are pre decided. For instance employers need male candidates for the heavy work such as repairing and installation of heavy machine. They prefer male staff for night shifts. They want female candidates for soft natured work like counseling, teaching, designing etc. Therefore, universities follow the requirement of job providers and decide subject suitable for particular gender.
 To conclude, I strongly believe that universities much open choice for everyone to select his subject. Our youth has become very confident towards his career. They are not ready to be bound in certain limitations. Female candidates also do not care about any restriction posed by the society and the employer. So we must give them opportunity to achieve their goal.";"Gender equality has been a hot topic of debate for many years, and it is especially relevant when discussing university admissions. In recent years, universities have been striving to create a more equitable admissions process, one that takes into account the unique experiences of both male and female applicants. This essay will explore the various ways in which universities are attempting to create a more equitable admissions process, and the potential benefits of such an approach.
 
 One of the most common ways in which universities are attempting to create a more equitable admissions process is by implementing gender-blind admissions policies. This means that the admissions committee does not consider the gender of the applicant when making their decision. Instead, they focus solely on the applicants academic and extracurricular achievements. This approach has been shown to reduce gender bias in the admissions process, as it eliminates the possibility of gender-based discrimination.
 
 Another way in which universities are attempting to create a more equitable admissions process is by implementing gender-based affirmative action policies. These policies are designed to ensure that both male and female applicants are given equal consideration during the admissions process. This can be done in a variety of ways, such as by providing additional points to female applicants or by setting aside a certain number of spots for female applicants.
 
 Finally, universities are also attempting to create a more equitable admissions process by providing additional resources and support to female applicants. This can include providing additional financial aid, mentorship programs, and other resources that can help female applicants succeed in their studies.
 
 Overall, universities are taking a number of steps to create a more equitable admissions process. By implementing gender-blind admissions policies, gender-based affirmative action policies, and providing additional resources and support to female applicants, universities are striving to create a more equitable admissions process that takes into account the unique experiences of both male and female applicants. This approach has the potential to create a more diverse and inclusive university environment, one that is more conducive to learning and growth.";"Gender Equality in University Admission
 
 In recent decades, gender equality has become a major factor in determining university admission. Equality between men and women in terms of education and access to job opportunities has improved significantly. Many universities have implemented gender equality policies, which ensure that both men and women get an equal opportunity to pursue higher studies. Gender equality in the matter of university admission is important because it enables both sexes to have equal access to educational opportunities.
 
 The goal of gender equality in university admission is to make sure that all qualified students, regardless of gender, have the same access and opportunities when applying to college. Universities must ensure that the admission process is fair and that no student is denied admission due to gender. This means that universities should not favor either gender over the other. Gender should not play any role in the admission process. All students should be given equal attention and a fair chance of admission.
 
 The process of achieving gender equality in university admission should be a collaborative effort between the universities and their students. Universities should make sure that their admission requirements are gender neutral and that their admissions policies are fair and equitable. It is also important to have a strong commitment to creating an inclusive, welcoming and safe environment for all students. Additionally, universities should provide support services such as counseling and mentoring to ensure that all students have equal access to the necessary resources.
 
 Universities can also create special initiatives to encourage gender equality in university admission. They can offer scholarships, grants and other financial aid opportunities to promote and encourage women's access to education. Moreover, universities should create a culture of respect and promote diversity and inclusion in their institution. They should also form partnerships with organizations and groups that support gender equality such as the National Alliance for Women's Rights.
 
 In conclusion, gender equality in university admission is an important factor for the success of both men and women in higher education. It helps universities create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for all students and ensures that everyone has an equal chance of admission. Universities should take the initiative and implement effective policies and initiatives to ensure gender equality in university admission.";39;1788;2337;2564;2450.5

Some people state that visiting museums is only a form of recreation; others disagree, arguing that museums play a role in education. In fact, each of these arguments has its own validity.
 Firstly, museums such as art and music can offer people with a wide range of entertainment activities. For example, they often organise traditional music events performed by local or other famous artists that people can attend to and enjoy to some extent. Another point is that many visitors nowadays may choose to come to museums just for pleasure or as one of the activities that they take part in their holiday trips. This, therefore, makes museums a place to entertain in people leisure time. 
 On the other hand, the establishment of a particular museum like history, science, or oceanography is usually attached to educational purposes. As can be seen, school and university students and teachers are always the guests of museums because the places are where they can discover and obtain a large amount of information related to their studies and teaching. In addition, there are a number of seminars and conferences held at museums that are informative and necessary for scholars and experts in their fields of research. In this way, museums prove the supporting role in human education.

19;essay20.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/student-talk-20/took-today-didnt-go-as-expected-6994/;Air pollution;"Air pullution is an issue threatening the enviorement in many different ways such as causing holes in the ozone and affecting global heating in the nagitve way. I believe that more reponsibilities should put on private individuals and companies such as paying to clean up air pollution. 
 First, in most industrialised countries, there is a number of companies that holds heavy factories in their constitutions. The waste products and harmful gases produced by these factories cause a significant amount of air pollution. While these companies make a huge amount of money from their bussinesses, most of them are not considering to take precautions to reduce the amount of air pollution. If these companies were obliged to pay to clean up the air pollution, they would at least make an effort to reduce the amount of air pollution they cause.
 Second, private individuals cause air pollution in several ways such as inessential use of cars and house heating. As house heating is a major need in the winter time, some households do not consider to use filters to reduce the amount of pollution that the heating causes. Instead of this, some expensive wehicles cause a huge amount of pollution. In my opinion, by charging private indiviuals for causing air pollution, that will at least contribute to reduce the amount of the pollution. 
 On the other hand, I believe that governments should restrict the use of products that cause air pollution for both individuals and companies. Governments also should use an amount of money from their budgets to clean up the air, instead of putting all the responsibility to companies and private individuals. 
 In conclusion, due to the fact that governments are responsible to provide a healthy enviorement for their inhabitants and they should be responsible from cleaning up the air pollution, both companies and private individuals should take the main part to clean up the air pollution.";"Air pollution is one of the most pressing environmental issues of our time. It is a major contributor to global warming, and it affects the health of people, animals, and the environment. Air pollution is caused by a variety of sources, including industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, and burning of fossil fuels.
 
 The most common type of air pollution is particulate matter, which is made up of tiny particles of dust, soot, and other pollutants. These particles can be inhaled and cause respiratory illnesses, such as asthma and bronchitis. They can also cause eye, nose, and throat irritation. Long-term exposure to air pollution can lead to more serious health problems, such as heart disease, stroke, and cancer.
 
 Air pollution also has a negative impact on the environment. It can damage crops, trees, and other vegetation, and it can contaminate water sources. It can also reduce visibility and create acid rain, which can damage buildings and other structures.
 
 The good news is that air pollution can be reduced. Governments can implement regulations to limit emissions from factories and vehicles. Individuals can also take steps to reduce air pollution, such as using public transportation, carpooling, and using energy-efficient appliances. Planting trees can also help reduce air pollution by absorbing pollutants and producing oxygen.
 
 In conclusion, air pollution is a serious problem that affects the health of people, animals, and the environment. It can be reduced through government regulations and individual action. Taking steps to reduce air pollution can help ensure a healthier future for everyone.";"Air pollution has become an increasingly urgent problem that threatens the health of the environment and human populations throughout the world. Pollutants such as ozone, carbon dioxide, and particulate matter are released into the atmosphere and can have a direct impact on human health and the environment. The causes of air pollution are numerous and varied, ranging from agricultural activities to industrial processes, and transportation. Additionally, air pollution has been linked to global warming, an ever more alarming concern in today's world.
 
 Air pollution is created through a number of sources. Diesel and gasoline-powered vehicles are the greatest single source of air pollution, releasing carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, and other pollutants into the atmosphere. Industrial sources, such as coal-burning power plants, factories, and refineries also produce air pollution in the form of particulate matter and other hazardous chemicals. Agricultural activities such as animal husbandry, crop burning, and the use of pesticides and fertilizers also add to the pollution of the air.
 
 The effects of air pollution can be quite severe. Ozone and particulate matter can contribute to poor air quality and poor health. Ozone is a major contributor to smog, which can damage lung tissues and cause respiratory ailments and even cancer. Particulate matter is linked to a range of diseases, including asthma, heart and lung disease, and stroke. Additionally, air pollutants can contribute to global warming, which is linked to extreme weather events, sea level rise, and the degradation of ecosystems.
 
 In order to reduce air pollution, both individual and collective action is needed. On a personal level, individuals can reduce their own pollution by driving less, avoiding chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and reducing the amount of energy they use in their homes. On a larger scale, governments and businesses can reduce air pollution by implementing regulations and technologies to reduce emissions from vehicles, power plants, and factories. Additionally, governments can invest in renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydropower to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and reduce air pollution.
 
 Air pollution is a growing problem that has far-reaching consequences. It can cause a range of health problems and contribute to global warming. In order to reduce air pollution and its effects, individuals, businesses, and governments need to work together to reduce emissions and invest in renewable energy sources. In doing so, the world can reduce air pollution and protect the environment and human health.";13;1930;1631;2656;2143.5
20;essay21.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/advertisements-affects-consumer-goods-preparing-7043/;Advertisements affects on consumer goods;"Everyday, companies offer a huge number of different products to consumers. The most effective way to convince consumers to purchase a product is through advertising. However, it is not sufficient in itself. The product also should satisfy the needs of the consumers. In my opinion, advertising is the major reason for high sales of a product for several reasons. 
 We are mainly introduced to products through advertisements. Therefore, advertisers push the limits of creativity to dispose the consumers to purchase the product. When the consumers are impressed by the way a product is advertised, they can be convinced to consider that the product is a need in some cases. Recently, there is a very creative advertisements of a soft drink product on TV. The story delivers a desired call to drink that soft drink that people tend to drink when the weather is too hot. As a result of this, the number of that product being sold will increases. 
 Also, the more an advertisement of a product takes place in mass media, the more popular the product becomes. Advertisement is the most effective way to create a well-known product. Consumers tend to purchase the most known product when it comes to picking one out of two different brands of the same product. When a product is commonly used, it becomes trustworthy for the society, no matter what quality it is.. However it also has to be affordable for the consumer. Considering this fact, advertisements have undeniable affects on the society about the product being advertised. They make the product preferable. 
 In conclusion, as I believe that consumers should consider major needs when they purchase goods, high sales are obviously a reflection of the powerful advertisements.";"Advertising has become an integral part of the modern consumer goods market. It has become a major factor in influencing consumer decisions and in driving sales of products. Advertising is used to create awareness of a product or service, to create a positive image of the product or service, and to persuade consumers to purchase the product or service.
 
 Advertising affects consumer goods in a variety of ways. First, it can create a positive image of the product or service. Advertising can be used to create an emotional connection between the consumer and the product or service. This can be done through the use of images, music, and other elements that create an emotional response in the consumer. Advertising can also be used to create a sense of urgency in the consumer, making them more likely to purchase the product or service.
 
 Second, advertising can be used to create a sense of loyalty in the consumer. Advertising can be used to create a sense of loyalty to a particular brand or product. This can be done through the use of loyalty programs, discounts, and other incentives. This can help to create a sense of loyalty to the product or service, making the consumer more likely to purchase the product or service.
 
 Third, advertising can be used to create a sense of urgency in the consumer. Advertising can be used to create a sense of urgency in the consumer, making them more likely to purchase the product or service. This can be done through the use of limited-time offers, discounts, and other incentives. This can help to create a sense of urgency in the consumer, making them more likely to purchase the product or service.
 
 Finally, advertising can be used to create a sense of trust in the consumer. Advertising can be used to create a sense of trust in the consumer, making them more likely to purchase the product or service. This can be done through the use of testimonials, endorsements, and other elements that create a sense of trust in the consumer. This can help to create a sense of trust in the consumer, making them more likely to purchase the product or service.
 
 In conclusion, advertising can have a significant impact on consumer goods. It can be used to create a positive image of the product or service, to create a sense of loyalty in the consumer, to create a sense of urgency in the consumer, and to create a sense of trust in the consumer. Advertising can be an effective tool in influencing consumer decisions and in driving sales of products.";"Advertising has become a part of our daily lives. Whether it is through television, radio, or websites, ads have become an integral part of our lives. Advertising is an effective way for companies to communicate their message, promote their products, and gain more customers. It can also have an effect on the types of products consumers purchase.
 
 Advertising is all about creating a demand for certain types of products, as well as influencing the way people think about products. Advertising campaigns are designed to make people want products, which are promoted as desirable and necessary. Companies use advertising to create an image of a product and to encourage people to buy it, while also promoting specific features they may not have known about. This can lead to people making purchases based on their desire to have the product, not necessarily because they need it.
 
 Advertising also has an effect on consumer behavior when it comes to pricing. In order to attract customers, companies may offer discounts or promotions with the purchase of certain items. This can lead to consumers buying more than they need in order to get the best deal. Advertising may also lead to consumers buying items that are not a good value, as companies can easily create the illusion of a deal.
 
 Advertising affects consumer behavior in many different ways. It can influence the products that people buy, as well as the way they think about them. Advertising can also affect pricing and lead to consumers purchasing items that are not a good value. It is important for consumers to be aware of these effects and make educated decisions about their purchases.";40;1731;2503;1658;2080.5
21;essay22.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/essay-young-people-should-go-university-not-17567/;Young people should go to university or not;"Persistent deliberation is happening as to whether it is desirable for the youth to go to university. In regard to the development of the country, some people believe that it is essential for young students to get high quality of education in universities, while others think that it is only one of causes to increase the rate of unemployment. In this essay, I will analyze both views first in order to come up with a fool-proof decision.
 To begin with, those who advocate the impracticability of university have several reasons. From their point of view, the fact is that there are numerous job opportunities for those who do not have the certification of university graduation, such as mechanics, sales persons, or engineers, and, furthermore, labors for graduates are in short supply. What is worse, the labor market for highly educated students is now too competitive to get a job after finishing their studying. In this regard it is a loss of national productivity that young people spend much time on searching for high salary jobs, even can be a sheer time-consuming.
 However, on the other side of the coin are voices in the opposition, saying that universities provide not only skills for careers, but also academic knowledge for the human race, such as bio science, politics, and medicine. These academic values are necessary to the progress of the world. More importantly, many researches in the ivory-tower have created ingenious discoveries and achievements for the development of modern society. Another significant factor of universities is that diverse experiences in the campus life can make the young generation more competently because there are a number of chances through internships, deeper discussion, independent life, and exchange scholarships.
 To sum up both contentions about the necessity of universities' education have reasonable justifications; however, I agree with the latter view. Although higher education does not guarantee young students' success, the benefits of learning in universities are the vital factor in creating more possibilities for the development of society through advancing academic fulfillment and the young generation who have experiences and challenges.
";"The debate over whether young people should go to university or not is a complex one. On the one hand, university can provide a valuable education and open up a range of career opportunities. On the other hand, it can be expensive and time consuming, and may not be the best choice for everyone. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to go to university should be based on individual circumstances and goals.
 
 For those who are looking to pursue a career in a specific field, university can be an invaluable asset. It can provide a comprehensive education in the chosen subject, as well as the opportunity to gain valuable experience through internships and other activities. Furthermore, having a university degree can be a major advantage when it comes to job applications, as employers often prefer candidates with a higher level of education.
 
 However, university is not the only route to success. For those who are looking to pursue a career in a more practical field, such as engineering or construction, there are often apprenticeship and vocational training options available. These can provide a more hands-on approach to learning, and may be more suitable for some individuals. Furthermore, they can often be completed in a shorter amount of time, and may be less expensive than university.
 
 Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to go to university should be based on individual circumstances and goals. For some, university may be the best option, while for others, an apprenticeship or vocational training may be more suitable. It is important to consider all of the options available, and to make an informed decision based on individual needs and aspirations.";"In the current job market, there is no denying that college education is becoming increasingly important. While there once was a time when a college degree was not necessary to find a well-paying job, todays employers increasingly prefer to hire those with post-secondary qualifications. As a result, more young people than ever are considering the possibility of going to university.
 
 There are many benefits of pursuing a college education. Most notably, studies have shown that college graduates tend to earn more than non-college graduates, regardless of their field of study. This means that a college degree can potentially open up opportunities for better career advancement and a higher salary. Additionally, a college education can provide students with important skills related to communication, problem-solving, and critical thinking that can be used in the workplace and in everyday life.
 
 On the other hand, the decision to attend university should not be taken lightly. College can be expensive, with tuition and other fees often making it difficult for some students to finance their degrees. Additionally, university may not be the right choice for everyone. For those who excel in technical fields such as engineering, a trade school may be more appropriate. Furthermore, it is important to consider whether the potential benefits of earning a university degree outweigh the costs and the potential for debt.
 
 Ultimately, the decision to go to university or not should be a personal one. While a college education can be beneficial, it is important to consider the costs involved and to make an informed choice. For some, the investment in a university degree may be worth it, while for others it may be not. It is important to weigh all of the pros and cons before making any final decisions.";43;2212;1690;1816;1753.0
22;essay23.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/essay-effects-mobile-phones-17519/;Effects of mobile phones;"Nowadays, the popularity of mobile phones has brought about a lot of convenience but at the meanwhile a variety of problems as well, such as social, medical and technical problems. However, I do not think these disadvantages will outweigh the advantages brought by cell phones. In this essay, I would like to analyse these three issues in order to support my viewpoint.
 First of all, almost everything that changed our lifestyle a lot will also cause some social problems. Mobile phones are not out of expectation. Speaking loudly on the phone in public areas, such as schools, libraries and hospitals appears to be very impolite and offensive. What is worse , some students utilize their cell phones as an effective cheating tools in examinations in which they can send and receive answers by texting each other. Nevertheless, it is not impossible to solve these problems, as long as some regulations and rules can be effectively implemented.
 It is also worth mentioning that some harmful effects on our health are lethal. It has been proved that overusing of the electronic devices including mobile phones could lead to higher possibility of suffering hearing loss and even cancers, although the further investigation are needed.
 Another debatable problem is about techniques. There is panic among people that their conversation can be intercepted by the third party. This possibility exists all the time. But a more efficient and reliable system can also be invented to guarantee the private information of users.
 Moreover, the mobile phone has become a dispensable multifunctional tools in people's daily life. Not only used for communication, but it also functions as an Internet browser, a music player , a personal organiser and so forth.
 In conclusion, nothing can be overused without side effects. The contribution of the mobile phone to our modern society is prominent and people's dependence on it is irreversible, although it has a number of problems that should be well handled.
";"Mobile phones have become an integral part of our lives. They have revolutionized the way we communicate, access information, and even entertain ourselves. However, like any technology, mobile phones have both positive and negative effects.
 
 The positive effects of mobile phones are numerous. They allow us to stay connected with friends and family, no matter where we are. We can stay in touch with people from all over the world, and even make new friends. Mobile phones also provide us with access to the internet, which can be used to research, shop, and stay up to date with the latest news. Additionally, mobile phones can be used to entertain ourselves with games, music, and videos.
 
 However, there are also some negative effects of mobile phones. For example, they can be distracting, especially when used while driving or in class. They can also be a source of cyberbullying, as people can use them to harass and intimidate others. Additionally, too much time spent on mobile phones can lead to physical health problems, such as neck and back pain, as well as mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety.
 
 In conclusion, mobile phones have both positive and negative effects. While they can be a great tool for communication and entertainment, they can also be a source of distraction and cyberbullying. It is important to use mobile phones responsibly and in moderation in order to maximize the positive effects and minimize the negative ones.";"Mobile phones have become a major part of our daily lives. They offer us the convenience of being able to stay connected with our friends, family, and colleagues at all times.
 
 However, aside from the many benefits of having a mobile phone, there are also some drawbacks that need to be explored. Through this essay, we will examine some of the major effects of mobile phones on peoples lives. 
 
 First, mobile phones can be a major distraction, particularly in the classroom. Texting and other forms of communication are all too easy and tempting, and can easily lead to students not paying full attention to the lecture. In addition, mobile phones can be a major distraction for drivers, and texting and driving has become an increasingly large problem. 
 
 Second, mobile phones have contributed to the growth of cyberbullying and other forms of online harassment. Social media and messaging apps can be used as a tool for bullies to target and harass their victims. Research has also shown that spending too much time on social media can lead to feelings of isolation and depression. 
 
 Third, mobile phones can be used to access sensitive data, including medical records and banking information. The rise of mobile phone viruses and malware has increased the risk of data breaches and identity theft. 
 
 Finally, mobile phones have made it easier to connect with people all around the world, but this can sometimes lead to oversharing of personal information. Sharing too much information on social media can lead to online predators and other online threats. 
 
 In conclusion, mobile phones have had an enormous impact on our daily lives, both in positive and negative ways. While these devices offer great convenience, it is important to be aware of the potential risks that can come with using them. By taking certain precautions, we can protect ourselves from the potential hazards of using mobile phones.";24;1997;1470;1920;1695.0
23;essay24.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/undergraduate-essays-2/taks-essay-computer-has-negative-effects-children-17155/;computer has negative effects to children;"Nowadays, thanks to the development of technology, computer is now indispensable to life. Some people think that computer is good for children and it should be used daily by children but some others think differently. In my opinion, the latter opinion is true.
 First, using computer constantly has bad influence on children's eyes. When they concentrate on computer for too long, their eyes will get tired, which is the main reason for some eyes problems, typically shortsighted.
 Moreover, children who play games too much on computer can seriously lack communicating skills, they will know little about the outside life. It is a well-known fact that people who are addicted to games, especially online games, can eventually bear dangerous consequences. For instance, several teenagers play games without rest, which leads to health depression, a typical example is the death of Korean gamer, who had a non-stop playing for 3 days.
 Finally, even people who are not interested in online game can still be negatively affected by using computer too much. Some social surveys have shown that a few children use computer for studying purpose, most of them are attracted by facebook, blog, etc. instead. Due to this neglect, they will have a bad result in school because when they can not live without internet, they will have no time for their studying.
 In conclusion, although it is undeniable that computer is a crucial part of human life, it still has its bad side, especially for children. People should learn how to use it properly to make it an effective tool because computer should be used not only for entertaining but also for working and studying purpose.
";"The use of computers by children has become increasingly popular in recent years. While computers can be a great educational tool, they can also have negative effects on children. This essay will discuss the potential negative effects of computers on children.
 
 One of the most significant negative effects of computers on children is the potential for addiction. Computers can be highly addictive, especially for children who may not have the self-control to limit their use. This can lead to a decrease in physical activity, which can have a negative impact on physical health. Additionally, excessive computer use can lead to an increase in sedentary behavior, which can lead to obesity and other health problems.
 
 Another potential negative effect of computers on children is the potential for cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is a form of bullying that takes place online, and it can be especially damaging to children who may not have the emotional maturity to handle it. Cyberbullying can lead to feelings of isolation, depression, and anxiety. It can also lead to a decrease in academic performance, as the child may be too distracted by the bullying to focus on their studies.
 
 Finally, computers can also have a negative effect on childrens social development. As children spend more time on computers, they may be less likely to interact with their peers in person. This can lead to a decrease in social skills, which can have a negative impact on their ability to form relationships and interact with others.
 
 In conclusion, computers can have a number of negative effects on children. These include addiction, cyberbullying, and a decrease in social development. It is important for parents to be aware of these potential risks and to take steps to limit their childrens computer use.";"The development of computer technology has revolutionized the way humans live and interact with each other. It has improved our access to knowledge and entertainment, made communication easier and faster, and provided a host of other benefits.
 
 However, as with any technology, computer use has some negative effects on children. While computers can be used for educational and entertainment purposes, too much computer time can lead to physical and mental health problems.
 
 The physical health effects of excessive computer use can be seen in children who spend too much time in front of a computer screen. Prolonged exposure to the blue light emitted by computer screens has been linked to eyestrain, headaches, and even obesity due to the lack of physical activity.
 
 The mental health side effects of computer use are just as concerning. Too much computer time can lead to depression, anxiety, and attention deficits. Spending too much time in the virtual world can encourage children to ignore their real-world responsibilities and to become more isolated. Additionally, the content children are exposed to on the internet can have a negative impact on their mental health, as they may be exposed to violence, pornography, or other inappropriate content.
 
 In order to minimize the negative effects of computer use, parents should be aware of their children's activities online and set time limits for computer use. Encouraging alternative activities such as sports or board games can also help to reduce their computer time. Lastly, parents can ensure that their children are accessing only age-appropriate content online and monitoring their online activity.
 
 In conclusion, computer use can have both positive and negative effects on children. While computers can provide educational and entertainment opportunities, too much computer time can lead to physical and mental health problems. To ensure that computer use is constructive and beneficial, parents should set time limits and monitor their children's activities online.";41;1666;1801;2043;1922.0
24;essay25.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/undergraduate-essays-2/essay-influence-large-factory-17115/;Influence Of Large Factory;"Nowadays, whether to establish large factories nearby housing areas has become a controversial issue in our society. Out of the case of economic development, industrial buildings are a necessary part of modern society. However a vast number of people are against building a factory near their community because of pollution. From my point of view, the advantages of building a factory will outweigh its disadvantages, if we tackle the environmental problems brought by factories.
 First of all, a large factory can stimulate local economic growth and reduce the unemployment rate. To manufacture goods, there must be the demand of laborers, from which the local residents can benefit. What is more, the factory is not isolated, other industries and business will be quickly established, resulting in economic growth of local area. For example, the estate industry will be boosted in order to satisfy the workers' accommodation need.
 The main disadvantage is contamination. It is truth that some area are suffering the dire consequences caused by overdeveloping the industry, such as water pollution, overcrowded traffic and medical problems. For instance, in some industrial cities , a large proportion of the workers are suffering various breathing problems, such as asthma which can be caused by waste ashes and certain chemical substances.
 However, it is inevitable that there will be more factories built with the development of our society. Therefore, how to improve the disadvantages of building a factory would be more important than whether to build it. In fact most problems can be avoidable if the factories put in real and great effort to manage their waste well.
 In conclusion, installation of manufacturing plant is a trend of industrialization for many countries. Its advantages will outweigh disadvantages as long as the factories dispose their waste and pollution in the correct way.
";"On Environment
 
 The influence of large factories on the environment is a major concern for many people. Large factories are responsible for a significant amount of pollution and environmental degradation, and their effects can be felt far and wide. This essay will explore the various ways in which large factories can have a negative impact on the environment, as well as the steps that can be taken to mitigate these effects.
 
 The most obvious way in which large factories can have a negative impact on the environment is through the release of pollutants into the air. These pollutants can include carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and other hazardous chemicals. These pollutants can cause a variety of health problems, including respiratory illnesses, heart disease, and cancer. In addition, these pollutants can also contribute to global warming, acid rain, and other environmental problems.
 
 Large factories can also have a negative impact on the environment through the release of wastewater. This wastewater can contain a variety of hazardous chemicals, including heavy metals, petroleum products, and other contaminants. These pollutants can contaminate local water sources, leading to health problems for people and animals. In addition, wastewater can also lead to the destruction of aquatic habitats, as well as the destruction of ecosystems.
 
 Finally, large factories can also have a negative impact on the environment through the production of noise. This noise can be disruptive to both humans and animals, and can lead to a decrease in quality of life. In addition, noise pollution can also lead to an increase in stress levels, which can have a negative impact on both physical and mental health.
 
 Fortunately, there are steps that can be taken to mitigate the negative impacts of large factories on the environment. One of the most effective ways to do this is to reduce the amount of pollutants that are released into the air. This can be done by implementing more efficient production processes, as well as by using cleaner energy sources. In addition, factories can also reduce their wastewater output by implementing better wastewater treatment systems. Finally, factories can also reduce their noise output by installing soundproofing materials and using quieter machinery.
 
 In conclusion, the influence of large factories on the environment is a major concern for many people. Large factories are responsible for a significant amount of pollution and environmental degradation, and their effects can be felt far and wide. Fortunately, there are steps that can be taken to mitigate these negative impacts, including reducing the amount of pollutants released into the air, reducing wastewater output, and reducing noise output. By taking these steps, we can help to ensure that our environment remains healthy and safe for future generations.";"In A Village
 
 In the present world, large industrial factories have become an inherent part of rural life, influencing the lives of the people in multiple ways. These factories have brought about many changes in the lifestyles of rural people, not all of which have been positive.
 
 On the one hand, the presence of large factories in a village opens up employment opportunities for the local population while, on the other hand, they may create an imbalance in the ecology of the village and lead to social issues.
 
 One of the most important positives that a large factory brings to a village is increased employment opportunities. The employees of the factory will be able to earn a good salary and help their families live better lives. This increased income can lead to an improved standard of living and an increased quality of life in the village. The new jobs also bring in new people from neighboring villages, which encourages an intermingling of cultures and ideas. This can help in the overall development of the village.
 
 However, this development is not all positive. With the presence of a large industrial factory comes environmental hazards such as air and water pollution and the destruction of natural resources. The noise and air pollution created by the factory can be very harmful to the people living in the village. The factory may also use up vital resources such as water which can lead to a shortage of water for the people living in the village.
 
 Apart from environmental degradation, the presence of a large industrial factory can also bring about social ills. This can be seen in cases where the factory owners use their influence to control the local government and manipulate the local population to their own ends. The gap between the rich, who are employed at the factory, and the poor can also lead to social unrest and discontent among the villagers.
 
 In conclusion, it is undeniable that large industrial factories can bring about significant changes in a village. While they can create job opportunities, they can also create social and environmental ills. It is, therefore, essential that all stakeholders, including the factory owners and the government, work together to create a balance between economic progress and social responsibility.";26;1903;2892;2291;2591.5
25;essay26.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/essay-prepared-food-17090/;Prepared Food;"Nowadays, more and more people begin to select prepared food as their daily meals, since it can effectively save time which is considered as money in our modern society. However it is obvious that cooked food can bring about some negative influence result from utilizing the artificial ingredients, ignoring the nutrition of food and modifying people's eating habits. In this essay, I would like to explain why this is not a good thing based on the three reasons above.
 First of all, to make their food easier to prepare and taste delicious, almost every producer adds a wide range of artificial ingredients in to the food that is now purchased by most people. Some ingredients being added have caused dire consequences. For instance, there are usually some articles in newspapers and magazines which report the relationship between certain chemical components in some food and diseases. Thus, easy-to-cook foods sometimes could be dangerous for human's health.
 Not cooking fresh food will also lead to the lack of nutrition. It is truth that cooking prepared foods needs much less time in comparison with the fresh food., whereas some research has apparently demonstrated that prepared foods are unable to support enough nutrients we need, especially for children who are growing up .
 In addition, cooking is one of arts humans create. The more cooked food we chosen, the more cooking skills we lose. At the increasing living pace, the majority of people tend to choose microwave as their unique cooker that help them prepare a dish in five minutes. But rare people have been aware that this has contributed to a modification of cooking habits, which may cause the loss of our custom and culture about cooking.
 In conclusion, although the invention of prepared foods definitely satisfies the demand of some people who are busy in their work, it is not a good thing. Cooking is not a waste of time, contrarily, it is crucial for our health and culture.
";"Prepared food is a type of food that has been cooked and packaged for sale in stores or restaurants. It is often seen as a convenient and time-saving alternative to cooking from scratch. Prepared food can be found in many forms, including frozen meals, canned goods, ready-to-eat meals, and pre-made ingredients.
 
 The convenience of prepared food has made it a popular choice for busy people who dont have time to cook from scratch. It is also a great option for those who are new to cooking or dont have the skills to make a meal from scratch. Prepared food is often more affordable than cooking from scratch, and it can be a great way to save money on groceries.
 
 Prepared food can also be a great way to get a variety of flavors and textures in a meal. Many prepared meals come with a variety of ingredients, such as vegetables, proteins, and grains, so you can create a balanced meal without having to buy and prepare each ingredient separately. Prepared food can also be a great way to try new flavors and recipes without having to invest a lot of time or money.
 
 However, there are some drawbacks to prepared food. Many prepared meals are high in sodium, fat, and sugar, which can be unhealthy if consumed in large amounts. Additionally, some prepared meals may contain preservatives or artificial ingredients that can be unhealthy. It is important to read the labels of prepared foods to make sure that they are healthy and contain ingredients that you are comfortable with.
 
 In conclusion, prepared food can be a convenient and affordable way to save time and money when it comes to meal preparation. However, it is important to read labels and be aware of the nutritional content of prepared foods to ensure that they are healthy and contain ingredients that you are comfortable with.";"Prepared food is a boon to modern society and has been an effective way to provide convenient meals for busy people for years. With an ever-growing range of options for take-out and delivery, and the availability of pre-packaged and frozen ready-made meals, it has never been easier to put food on the table.
 
 The advantages of prepared food are evident  both in the convenience it provides and the nutritional value it can offer. For those who are time-poor or lack the skills to cook, it eliminates the need to spend time shopping, preparing, and cooking meals. Additionally, most prepared meals now offer options which are low in fat, low in sodium, or made with high-quality, healthy ingredients, making them an attractive option for health-conscious families.
 
 However, while it has become a popular choice for busy people, there are also some potential drawbacks. Prepared meals are often more expensive than cooking from scratch, and the nutritional value is not always up to scratch. Many prepared meals are full of saturated fat, added sodium, and other unhealthy ingredients, which can offset any time savings.
 
 For this reason, its important to look for nutritious, balanced meals that are low in unhealthy ingredients, whenever possible. Look for meals which are made with high-quality ingredients, and look for meals that contain lean proteins and plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables. And, of course, its always a good idea to look for healthier frozen and pre-packaged meals which can be prepared quickly and easily.
 
 In short, prepared food can be a great way to provide convenience for busy families, but its important to take the time to find meals which are healthy and nutritious, too. With a bit of research and careful shopping, its possible to enjoy the convenience of prepared meals without sacrificing on quality or nutrition.";13;1957;1801;1860;1830.5
26;essay27.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/essay-financial-aid-developing-countries-17035/;Financial Aid To Developing Countries;"As is commonly understood, there is an increasingly gap between developed countries and developing countries. It can be seen that some developed countries and organization are proving financial assistance to the impoverished countries. However, it is disagreed that this can be the best and only way to assist developing countries. This will be proven by analyzing the necessity of developing their education and the real objective of supporters.
 Firstly, education is an essential part in development. For instance, most developing countries are lack of educational resources, such as experienced teachers, evaluation systems and teaching facilities, which is usually neglected by local authorities. From this example, it is obvious that if the developed countries are unwilling to share their successful experience in education, the developing countries will remain undeveloped, even though they gain a great deal of economic support. Thus, the critical method to improve the condition of poor countries is to help them build up a complete educational system instead of financial aid.
 In addition, it is well acknowledged that there is no free lunch in the world. This means some powerful countries provide financial support in order to acquire the right to exploit the local resources and target the local labour market. Indeed, they rarely provide local residents with any technological aid and even cause contamination in some areas. Therefore, developing countries should not totally depend on the financial support from powerful countries.
 In conclusion, financial aid is not the only way to assist poor countries. And it has been proven that developing education and improving national technology and science level are the path they have to undergo if they really want to alter current situation.
";"Financial aid to developing countries has become an increasingly important issue in the global economy. With the world becoming increasingly interconnected, the need for financial assistance to those countries that are struggling to meet their basic needs has become more pressing. Developing countries are often in need of assistance to help them build infrastructure, provide basic services, and create jobs. Financial aid can be used to help these countries achieve their goals and improve their economic and social conditions.
 
 Financial aid can come in many forms, including grants, loans, and other forms of assistance. Grants are typically provided by governments or international organizations such as the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund. These grants are often used to fund infrastructure projects, provide basic services, and create jobs. Loans are typically provided by private lenders, such as banks or other financial institutions. These loans are often used to finance large-scale projects, such as building roads or providing electricity.
 
 In addition to grants and loans, there are other forms of financial assistance that can be provided to developing countries. These include technical assistance, which can help countries develop their economies and improve their standards of living. Technical assistance can include providing advice on how to improve economic policies, providing training for workers, and helping to build infrastructure.
 
 Financial aid to developing countries is essential for their economic development. Without it, these countries would be unable to make the necessary investments in infrastructure and services that are needed to improve their economic and social conditions. Financial aid can also help to reduce poverty and inequality, which are two of the most pressing issues facing the world today.
 
 Financial aid to developing countries is not without its challenges. For example, there are often issues of corruption and mismanagement of funds. Additionally, there is the risk that the money provided may not be used for its intended purpose. It is therefore important for governments and international organizations to ensure that the funds are used properly and that the money is not wasted.
 
 In conclusion, financial aid to developing countries is an important issue in the global economy. It can help to improve the economic and social conditions of these countries, reduce poverty and inequality, and create jobs. However, it is important to ensure that the funds are used properly and that the money is not wasted.";"Financial aid is a form of assistance provided by the international community to developing countries in need of financial support to improve their economic and social welfare. The primary aim of financial aid for developing countries is to provide the necessary resources to help the people of those countries enjoy a better quality of life. The international organizations providing financial aid to developing countries may include multilateral organizations such as the World Bank, regional organizations such as the African Development Bank, and individual countries.
 
 When providing financial aid to developing countries, the donor institution or country has to ensure that the money is well spent and used to further the development of the recipient country. This could mean that the financial aid may be used to finance projects such as infrastructure, healthcare, education and aid with poverty alleviation. The financial aid can also help to stimulate the local economy by creating jobs and increasing trade opportunities. These efforts can, in turn, help to reduce poverty and inequality, and reduce the risk of political instability.
 
 When providing financial aid to developing countries, it is important to consider the sustainability of the projects financed. The donor institution or country should ensure that the financial aid is being used for long-term developmental goals, as opposed to short-term relief. This is especially important for projects such as infrastructure, as the recipient country needs to be able to maintain and upgrade the infrastructure over time. The donor institution or country should also ensure that the financial aid is not being used for activities associated with corruption and misuse, and that the funds are being used for the intended purpose.
 
 Financial aid to developing countries can be an effective tool in helping to address global poverty and inequality. However, it is also important to consider the long-term effects of providing such aid, as the recipient country needs to be able to sustain the projects and benefits of the financial aid over time. The donor institution or country should also ensure that the financial aid is being used for activities aimed at creating a more equitable and functioning society. By ensuring that the money is used effectively and responsibly, financial aid can be a powerful tool in addressing global poverty and inequality.";37;1808;2593;2425;2509.0
27;essay28.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/society-should-ban-all-forms-advertising-essay-for-16697/;Society should ban all forms of the advertising;"It is no secret that advertising become inseparable part of our modern life. We come across with ads almost everywhere and everyday. Some people argue that companies by advertising their goods or services spend their money for nothing. Other critics say that ads have no purpose, they only cause damages to society and all forms of advertising should be banned.
 On my part I would like to solve this issue on a different way. Society does need an advertising but it is our responsibility to control the content and what kind of goods and services we would like to offer to our customers.
 First of all, I do support the idea that advertising alcohol, cigarettes, goods and services with adult content should be prohibited. Because these kind of ads will have negative effect to our children. Youngsters might be tempted to buy cigarettes or alcohol and later to start consume it on a daily basis. Fortunately, some countries take this issue seriously and advertising alcohol, cigarettes and materials with adult content is banned on those countries.
 On the other hand by advertising companies, businesses, firms and individuals promote their goods and services. Thanks to ads we learn about new products, we can compare them and choose whats it the best for us.
 These days, not only many businesses, but also governments have to rely on advertising. For example, tourism makes up one-third of the Czech Republic's economy. In order to promote the country's attractions, the Czech government has to advertise and sell its services to foreign consumers. Only well planned and well targeted advertising will bring more foreign tourists to the country.
 In conclusion, I think that modern society needs advertising. Ads will keep as well informed about new products and services, but we should also bear in mind that advertising cigarettes and alcohol will definitely affect our children in negative way.
";"Advertising is a powerful tool used by businesses to promote their products and services. It is a form of communication that is used to influence peoples opinions and behaviors. Advertising has become an integral part of our daily lives, and it is hard to escape its influence. While advertising can be beneficial in some ways, it can also have a negative impact on society. For this reason, some people argue that society should ban all forms of advertising.
 
 The primary argument for banning all forms of advertising is that it can be detrimental to society. Advertising can create unrealistic expectations and can lead to unhealthy behaviors. For example, advertisements for unhealthy foods can lead to poor dietary choices, while advertisements for beauty products can lead to body image issues. Advertising can also be used to manipulate people into buying products they dont need or cant afford. This can lead to financial problems and debt. In addition, advertising can be used to spread false information and can be used to exploit vulnerable populations.
 
 However, there are also arguments against banning all forms of advertising. Advertising can be used to promote positive messages and can be used to inform people about products and services that can be beneficial to them. It can also be used to promote social causes and to raise awareness about important issues. In addition, advertising can be used to create jobs and can be an important source of revenue for businesses.
 
 Ultimately, the decision to ban all forms of advertising should be made carefully. It is important to consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of such a ban. While it is important to protect society from the negative effects of advertising, it is also important to consider the potential benefits that advertising can bring.";"Advertising has long been used by companies to help promote their products and services, but it has been found to have harmful effects on society. Advertising has the potential to create unrealistic expectations, lead to overconsumption and waste, and fuel consumerism through targeted marketing. As a result, it has become clear that society should ban all forms of advertising. 
 
 Advertising can lead to unrealistic expectations in consumers. Advertising often portrays the product or service being advertised in the best possible light, making it appear more appealing than it really is. This can lead people to make unrealistic assumptions about the product or service and its capabilities, causing them to be disappointed when their expectations are not met. By banning all advertising, people would no longer be exposed to unrealistic representations of products and services, reducing their likelihood to set irrational expectations. 
 
 In addition, advertising can lead to overconsumption and waste. When companies are trying to create advertisements, they are often using flashy techniques to make their goods and services appear more desirable. This can lead to people feeling the need to purchase goods and services even if they do not need them, leading to unnecessary consumption. Furthermore, this can also lead to increased waste, as people are more likely to discard products when they are no longer used. By banning advertising, people would not be enticed to buy goods and services they do not need, reducing overconsumption and waste. 
 
 Finally, advertising can fuel consumerism through targeted marketing. Companies often use advertising to target specific consumer groups in order to boost their sales. By creating advertisements that appeal to a certain group, companies can influence potential customers to buy their products and services even if they do not necessarily need them. This can lead to people buying goods and services based solely on their appeal, rather than their practicality. By banning all advertising, companies would no longer be able to use targeted marketing to fuel consumerism, leading to people making more rational purchasing decisions. 
 
 Overall, society should ban all forms of advertising in order to reduce unrealistic expectations, overconsumption and waste, and consumerism. By cutting off access to advertisements, people would no longer be influenced by the unrealistic portrayals of products and services. Additionally, banning all advertising would reduce overconsumption and waste, as people would no longer feel the need to purchase goods and services they do not need. Finally, companies would no longer be able to use targeted marketing to influence consumer buying decisions, allowing people to make more rational decisions. For these reasons, it has become clear that society should ban all forms of advertising.";47;1904;1825;2885;2355.0
28;essay29.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/essay-married-women-usually-work-why-not-16560/;Do married women usually work? Why and why not?;"Personally, I believe that married women nowadays have right to take up jobs like men when employment discrimination based on gender have been erased significantly. Working outside home will bring a lot of benefits to both married woman and their household. I will mention some basic reasons as following.
 Firstly, extra income that women earn will contribute to their family's expenses. By taking up a job, a wife can earn more money to support her family life. This is really necessary in cases of her husband's low salary and the difficulty of getting a good job at the present. So, it is a normal practice for women to be helpmates in earning money.
 Secondly, working outside the house creates opportunities for married women to contact with the outer world, strengthen their character and show their capacity. These things in turn will make them more confident, independent. These women will set a good example for their children. Therefore, it is no doubt that they play roles as a mother and as a wife better.
 Last but not least, nowadays, there are many supporting conditions that help women balance housework and work. Besides the gorvernment's policies on limited families and their husbands' sharing in the housework, many employers are willing to offer part-time jobs for women.
 In conclusion, a well-organized home does not need the housewife's presence the whole day long and married women could go to work in order to enjoy the working life outside the home.
";"Married women have traditionally been expected to stay at home and take care of the household and family, while their husbands go out to work. However, in recent years, this has changed drastically and more married women are now working than ever before.
 
 There are a number of reasons why married women are now more likely to work than in the past. One of the most important reasons is economic necessity. With the cost of living rising, many married couples find that they need two incomes to make ends meet. This means that both the husband and wife must work in order to support their family.
 
 Another reason why married women are more likely to work is that they are now more educated than ever before. With more women attending college and university, they are more likely to have the qualifications and skills needed to get a job. This means that they are more likely to be able to find employment and support their families.
 
 Finally, there is a growing trend of married women wanting to pursue their own careers and ambitions. Many women now want to have a career and be able to contribute to their familys financial security. This means that they are more likely to look for work and be able to support their families.
 
 Overall, it is clear that married women are now more likely to work than in the past. This is due to a combination of economic necessity, increased education levels, and a desire to pursue their own ambitions. As a result, married women are now playing a much more important role in the workforce than ever before.";"Married women working has become increasingly common in recent years in many parts of the world, however the decision to work or not to work still differs from country to country and even within families. The answer to the question of whether married women usually work is not a simple yes or no. Married women work for a variety of reasons including financial obligations, career advancement, and personal fulfillment. 
 
 In some countries, getting married and working are two separate decisions that can be made independently. In others, such as India, the decision to work is often tied to marriage, with a spouses economic and occupational status playing a significant role. In certain countries, a working woman is seen as a sign of financial stability and support for the family, and for many, a job is a necessity for achieving financial success and providing for the family. 
 
 In developed countries, the opportunity to work is seen as an important factor in the decision to marry. For example, in the United States, the gap between mens and womens wages has been narrowing, increasing the potential for a dual-income marriage. This can create a marriage bonus, where two incomes provide a higher standard of living than either spouse could have achieved on their own. 
 
 The availability of family-friendly policies and support systems also plays a role in the decision to work or not. In countries that offer generous maternity and paternity leave, access to affordable childcare, and other policies to support working parents, married women may be more likely to work. In countries with fewer resources or support services, married women may prefer to stay home to take care of their families. 
 
 For some married women, the decision to work or not is based largely on their own personal goals and ambitions. For some, work provides personal fulfillment and a chance to pursue a career they are passionate about. It can also provide a sense of independence and financial security. Others choose to focus on their families, taking pleasure in the role of being a caregiver and homemaker. 
 
 In conclusion, married women usually work for a variety of reasons, including personal goals, financial necessity, and access to family-friendly resources. Ultimately, the decision to work or not is largely up to the individual and her family circumstances.";47;1478;1552;2364;1958.0

I completely agree that government should provide those education to their people; however, for the more higher education like university, the students or their parents should pay for the fees.
 Some parents might not have enough money to pay for their children university fees. In the other hand, I don't think it is also fair for the government as the government has been paying a lot of money for their students' primary and secondary education. It is better for them to use the money to pay for the other students' education so that all people in their country could receive the same education.
 Moreover, students that already have a basic knowledge and education can get a part-time job and they can pay for their own studies when their parent could not afford to pay it. They will be more responsible with their studies when they pay the fees themselves. In addition to that, the students will become more independent and it will build their characters in the marketplace as well.
 Furthermore, this will encourage all the parents to think of the way to help their children to achieve more in their lives as they need to make some contribution too for their children future.
 In conclusion, I completely agree that government should not pay for the university fees because this will make both the parents and students in charge for their future themselves not just depend on the government to do all their responsibilities for them.
";"Government and education are two of the most important aspects of any society. The government is responsible for providing the resources and infrastructure needed to ensure that education is available to all citizens. Education, in turn, is essential for the development of a strong and prosperous nation.
 
 The government has a direct role in education. It sets the standards for what is taught in schools and provides funding for the schools. It also sets the curriculum and determines the qualifications of teachers. The government also has a role in ensuring that all students have access to quality education, regardless of their socio-economic background.
 
 Education is essential for the development of a strong and prosperous nation. It provides the skills and knowledge necessary for individuals to be productive members of society. Education also helps to create a more informed and engaged citizenry, which is essential for a healthy democracy.
 
 Education is also important for economic development. A well-educated population is more likely to be productive and innovative, which can lead to increased economic growth. Education also helps to reduce poverty and inequality, as it provides individuals with the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in the job market.
 
 The government and education are closely linked. The government provides the resources and infrastructure needed to ensure that education is available to all citizens. Education, in turn, is essential for the development of a strong and prosperous nation. Without a strong education system, a nation cannot develop and progress.
 
 In conclusion, government and education are two of the most important aspects of any society. The government provides the resources and infrastructure needed to ensure that education is available to all citizens. Education, in turn, is essential for the development of a strong and prosperous nation. Without a strong education system, a nation cannot develop and progress.";"The relationship between government and education is a key factor in the success of any nation. Educational institutions have been a part of our societies since the dawn of civilization and it is only logical that governments should play an important role in their governance. Governments are responsible for setting up and maintaining the educational framework within which educational institutions can exist and function. This essay will discuss the various ways in which governments shape the educational system and how education in turn helps governments.
 
 The government plays a fundamental role in the provision of educational opportunities. On the one hand, it is responsible for setting up and regulating the educational system within which educational institutions can operate. This means providing funding to institutions or sponsoring programs that allow students to access educational opportunities. It also entails providing support for educational personnel, such as teachers and professors, as well as the infrastructure and technology that enable teaching and learning.
 
 On the other hand, the government is also responsible for managing and guiding educational policy. This includes setting curriculum, establishing standards and guidelines, and providing support for research and training. Educational policies are generally set in accordance with the goals and objectives of the government and can have direct implications on the quality of education provided by educational institutions.
 
 Education, in turn, has a direct influence on the success of a government. A well-educated population is more capable of making informed decisions and has a better understanding of the complexities of modern governance and democracy. Furthermore, a well-educated population will have more access to the tools to participate in political discourse and decision-making processes. This means that a government's success is directly related to the level of education provided in the country.
 
 The relationship between government and education is complex and far-reaching. Governments are responsible for creating and maintaining the educational infrastructure within which educational institutions can exist and operate. However, education itself has a major role in shaping how a government operates and is ultimately judged by the public. It is up to the government to ensure that the educational system is well-structured and provides people with the resources and opportunities they need to succeed. This way, a government can ensure that its citizens are well-educated and informed and can help to improve the overall well-being of society.";24;1538;1992;2658;2325.0
30;essay31.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/alternative-forms-transport-alleviate-traffic-congestion-40138/;Alternative forms of transport to alleviate traffic congestion;"Recently, a great deal of attention has been paid to means of transportation. Some state that automobile is the most convenient transportation, while others assert that alternative forms of transport should be considered in view of environmental pollution. In my opinion, I strongly agree that alternative means of transportation and international laws in controlling automobiles should be introduced. In this essay, several reasons will be described carefully in the following passages.
 Firstly, an increase in the number of automobiles brings about environmental pollution. Since automobile exhaust and carbon dioxides emission have bad impacts on the air, the air gets to be polluted and it causes respiratory disease of the local inhabitants. Therefore, it is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles.
 Secondly, an increase in the number of automobiles causes terrible traffic congestion. Once we get into the traffic jam, it forces us to waste our time for a while. What is worse, traffic congestion irritates drivers and as a result, it leads to an increase of traffic accidents. Thus, the methods to reduce the number of automobiles and to control car ownership and use should be immediately planned and implemented.
 In order to solve these problems, alternative forms of transportation and international laws to control automobiles ownership and use can work effectively. With regard to the former, alternative forms which emit less carbon dioxides and gasses than automobiles are ideal. For example, rental bicycle system has been introduced in several European countries. This system is that at the corner of each district, the rental bicycles are placed and the people can ride it to the other districts with a small fee. Since bicycle expels neither carbon dioxides nor harmful gasses, it is a better form to protect environment than automobile. As for the latter point, the introduction of international laws can be also effective. For instance, there are some regulations to limit the use of automobiles by time and to allow the people possess one car only. Thus, these attempts to reduce automobiles can ease traffic congestion and environmental pollution.
 In summary, even though some people claim the convenience of automobile, I would state that alternative forms of transport and international laws on controlling automobiles are necessary due to the environmental protection and the alleviation of traffic congestion.
";"Introduction
 
 Traffic congestion is a growing problem in many cities around the world. It is a major cause of air pollution, noise pollution, and wasted time and energy. To reduce traffic congestion, cities must explore alternative forms of transport. This essay will discuss the potential of public transportation, cycling, and walking as alternative forms of transport to alleviate traffic congestion.
 
 Public Transportation
 
 Public transportation is one of the most effective ways to reduce traffic congestion. By providing reliable and affordable public transportation, cities can encourage people to leave their cars at home and take public transport instead. This reduces the number of cars on the road and helps to reduce traffic congestion. Furthermore, public transportation is often more efficient than cars, as it can move more people in less time.
 
 Cycling
 
 Cycling is another effective way to reduce traffic congestion. By providing safe and accessible cycling infrastructure, cities can encourage people to cycle instead of drive. This reduces the number of cars on the road and helps to reduce traffic congestion. Furthermore, cycling is a great form of exercise and can help to improve peoples health.
 
 Walking
 
 Walking is another alternative form of transport that can help to reduce traffic congestion. By providing safe and accessible pedestrian infrastructure, cities can encourage people to walk instead of drive. This reduces the number of cars on the road and helps to reduce traffic congestion. Furthermore, walking is a great form of exercise and can help to improve peoples health.
 
 Conclusion
 
 In conclusion, public transportation, cycling, and walking are all effective ways to reduce traffic congestion. By providing reliable and affordable public transportation, safe and accessible cycling infrastructure, and safe and accessible pedestrian infrastructure, cities can encourage people to leave their cars at home and take alternative forms of transport instead. This will help to reduce traffic congestion and improve peoples health.";"Introduction: 
 Vehicular traffic congestion is a major issue today, especially in developing countries. The roads and highways are filled with ever increasing numbers of automobiles, resulting in an increase in traffic problems, air pollution, and noise. With the number of motor vehicles on the rise, it is important to look for alternative forms of transport that can alleviate traffic congestion.
 
 Body: 
 One way to ease traffic congestion is to invest in public transport infrastructure. This includes public buses, light rail, trams, and other modes of mass transit. Public transport offers an efficient and affordable way to move large numbers of people with minimal resources and fuel, while reducing the number of vehicles on the roads. Additionally, public transport can provide transportation to areas of the city that may not be connected through automobile travel, thus reducing the need to drive.
 
 Another alternative to automobile transportation is to encourage the use of cycling. Bicycle schemes provide a convenient way to get around town while providing a healthy form of exercise. In addition to providing a convenient way to get around, cycling reduces the number of vehicles on the roads and helps reduce air pollution.
 
 Walking can also help reduce traffic congestion. Walking provides an affordable way to get around, especially for short distances. Furthermore, it requires no fuel or other resources, and can be done at any time of day without worry about traffic. Walking also encourages people to explore their surroundings and enjoy the natural environment.
 
 Finally, carpooling can reduce the number of vehicles on the roads. Carpooling is a great way to save fuel, money, and reduce air pollution. It can also provide a social benefit, as it encourages people to connect and share rides with one another.
 
 Conclusion: 
 In conclusion, there are numerous alternative forms of transport that can help alleviate traffic congestion. From public transport systems to cycling and walking, these alternatives can reduce the number of vehicles on the roads while also providing a healthy and affordable way to get around. With the right investment in infrastructure and promotion, these forms of alternative transport can help make cities more livable, reduce air pollution, and make life easier for everyone.";62;2507;2082;2343;2212.5
31;essay32.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/giving-aid-poorer-countries-has-more-negative-effects-than-18453/;Giving aid to poorer countries has more negative effects than positive effect;"In this world, there is no one who does not know this world 'globalization', which means the world are more closer, and every single countries affects each other more than before in many ways. That is why governmental and non-governmental organizations have been focus on being harmony and contribute to aid to poor countries. It is true that just giving aid to impoverished countries could be manipulated by big power countries. In addition, a great amount of materials and money have poor countries being corrupted and politically dependent on other countries.
 However, I agree that aiding poor countries has positive effects, overweighing its side-effects for the several reasons.
 First of all, poor counties suffer from shortage of basic materials and facilities to start businesses and make it richer. To be out of poverty, it is fundamental to support basic industry related factors such as light, electricity, load, highways, natural resources, technology and buildings for companies. Aiding help poor countries in this situation solve their economical problems and run their own business. In actual, republic of Korea used to be the poorest country even compared to others in Africa in 1960's. Now that it has became strong economy country aiding poor countries after 10 years of aid from other counties.
 Secondly, aiding campaign gives a chance to considerate about poor people. If people in rich countries ponder poor people suffering from poverty and diseases, they would never take their abundance for granted. It not only raises the notice the meaning of harmony and love, but also be a good chance to learn humane doctrine of globalization.
 Third, the campaigns might include practical benefits. In globalized world, the economies of several countries are in a big network and must influence on each others. When America mortgage loan system went bad, several economies of European and Asian countries fluctuated, even any countries had to be gotten international supports to block its bankrupt.
 In conclusion, there are abovementioned three key points of positive effects of aid; supporting poor countries to make its economy strong and building humane concepts to people, keeping strong global economy. I strongly believe that being a global neighbor by aiding poor countries would be continues by many organizations and volunteers, and it will make the earth a better place to live.
";"Giving aid to poorer countries has been a controversial topic for many years. On one hand, it is argued that providing aid to poorer countries can help to reduce poverty and improve the quality of life for people living in those countries. On the other hand, it is argued that giving aid to poorer countries can have more negative effects than positive effects. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument and will ultimately conclude that giving aid to poorer countries has more negative effects than positive effects.
 
 The primary argument in favor of giving aid to poorer countries is that it can help to reduce poverty and improve the quality of life for people living in those countries. This is because aid can be used to fund projects that provide access to clean water, education, healthcare, and other basic necessities. It can also be used to fund infrastructure projects that can improve the economy of the country and create jobs. Furthermore, aid can be used to fund programs that promote democracy and human rights.
 
 However, there are also several negative effects associated with giving aid to poorer countries. For example, aid can create a dependency on foreign aid, which can lead to a lack of self-sufficiency and a lack of motivation to develop the countrys own resources. Furthermore, aid can be misused by corrupt governments and can lead to a lack of accountability and transparency. Additionally, aid can lead to a decrease in the value of the local currency, which can make it difficult for local businesses to compete with foreign businesses.
 
 In conclusion, it is clear that giving aid to poorer countries can have both positive and negative effects. However, the negative effects of giving aid to poorer countries outweigh the positive effects. Therefore, it is important to ensure that any aid given to poorer countries is used responsibly and effectively in order to ensure that it has a positive impact on the lives of people living in those countries.";"In todays modern world, it is becoming increasingly difficult for poorer countries to keep up with the wealthier nations that surround them. As a result, many people in the world argue that giving aid to poorer countries has more negative effects than positive effects. While it is true that giving aid to countries with fewer resources can indeed have negative consequences, the advantages of doing so far outweigh the potential drawbacks.
 
 One of the biggest advantages to giving aid to poorer countries is that it can help provide the resources necessary to help them develop and become economically self-sufficient. By providing access to funds for infrastructure projects, schools, and other basic needs, countries in need can begin to make improvements in their lives. Moreover, providing aid can help instill a sense of international responsibility, allowing poorer nations to become more resilient and self-sufficient in the future.
 
 Additionally, providing aid to poorer countries can also have a significant impact on global poverty. By giving aid to those in greatest need, countries can help to reduce the number of short-term and long-term issues that come with poverty. This can include providing access to essential resources, such as clean water, healthcare, and education, as well as encouraging economic stability. By helping to reduce global poverty, countries can help to promote peace and stability around the world.
 
 Furthermore, providing aid to poorer countries can also help to create an environment of global cooperation. As poorer nations become more stable, they can become more open to trade and investment, which can help to create a more balanced and prosperous world. This can lead to increased economic growth and development, improve cooperation with other nations, and create a more stable and secure global community.
 
 However, it is important to recognize that, although providing aid to poorer countries can bring about immense benefits, there are also some potential drawbacks. For instance, if aid is not managed properly, it can lead to dependency on external aid and foster corruption in the receiving nation. Additionally, if the aid provided is not tailored to the specific needs of the country, it can lead to long-term problems such as inflation and economic instability.
 
 In conclusion, while there can be potential drawbacks to providing aid to poorer countries, the overall benefits far outweigh any potential negatives. By providing resources to help develop infrastructure, reduce poverty, and create global cooperation, poorer countries can become more economically self-sufficient and globally integrated. Thus, helping to create a more stable, prosperous, and secure world.";77;2405;1997;2737;2367.0
32;essay33.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/effects-globalization-decrease-global-tension-18439/;effects of globalization (decrease in global tension);"During the history of the world, every change has its own positive and negative sides. Globalization as a gradual change affecting all over the world is not an exception. Although it has undeniable effects on the economics of the world; it has side effects which make it a controversial issue.
 Some people prefer to recognize globalization as a threat to ethnic and religious values of people of their country. They think that the idea of globalization put their inherited culture in danger of uncontrolled change and make them vulnerable against the attack of imperialistic governments.
 Those who disagree, believe that globalization contribute effectively to the global improvement of the world in many aspects. Developing globalization, people can have more access to many natural resources of the world and it leads to increasing the pace of scientific and economic promotions of the entire world. In addition, they admit that globalization can be considered a chance for people of each country to promote their lifestyle through the stuffs and services imported from other countries.
 Moreover, the proponents of globalization idea point out globalization results in considerable decrease in global tension due to convergence of benefits of people of the world which is a natural consequence of globalization.
 In conclusion, I would rather classify myself in the proponents of globalization as a speeding factor of global progress. I think it is more likely to solve the problems of the world rather than intensifying them.
";"Globalization has been a major force in the world since the end of the Cold War. It has been a driving force behind the increased economic interdependence of countries, the spread of technology, and the growth of international trade. It has also had a profound effect on global politics, with a decrease in global tension and an increase in cooperation between nations.
 
 The end of the Cold War marked the beginning of a new era of globalization. With the fall of the Soviet Union, the world was no longer divided into two distinct blocs. This allowed for increased economic and political cooperation between countries, as well as the spread of technology and ideas. This increased cooperation has led to a decrease in global tension, as countries are now more willing to work together to solve global problems.
 
 The increased economic interdependence of countries has also had a major effect on global tension. As countries become more economically intertwined, they become more dependent on each other for goods and services. This creates a situation where countries are less likely to go to war with each other, as they would be risking their own economic well-being. This has led to a decrease in global tension, as countries are now more likely to resolve disputes through diplomacy and negotiation rather than through military force.
 
 The spread of technology has also had a major effect on global tension. As technology has become more accessible, it has allowed for increased communication between countries. This has allowed for the sharing of ideas and information, which has helped to foster cooperation between countries. This increased communication has also allowed for the resolution of disputes through dialogue rather than through military force, leading to a decrease in global tension.
 
 Finally, the growth of international trade has had a major effect on global tension. As countries become more economically intertwined, they become more dependent on each other for goods and services. This creates a situation where countries are less likely to go to war with each other, as they would be risking their own economic well-being. This has led to a decrease in global tension, as countries are now more likely to resolve disputes through diplomacy and negotiation rather than through military force.
 
 In conclusion, globalization has had a major effect on global tension, leading to a decrease in global tension and an increase in cooperation between nations. The end of the Cold War, increased economic interdependence, the spread of technology, and the growth of international trade have all contributed to this decrease in global tension. As countries become more economically intertwined, they become more dependent on each other for goods and services, leading to a situation where countries are less likely to go to war with each other. This has led to a decrease in global tension, as countries are now more likely to resolve disputes through diplomacy and negotiation rather than through military force.";"Globalization is a process of interaction and integration among people, companies, and governments around the world. It has increased the interconnectedness of the world and has impacted all aspects of life, from culture and entertainment, to economy and politics. The effects of globalization can be seen in a number of ways, including a decrease in global tension.
 
 One way globalization has contributed to a decrease in global tension is through cultural exchanges. Cultural exchanges allow people to learn about each others beliefs, customs, and traditions. Through cultural exchange, individuals can build bridges of understanding, respect, and appreciation for different cultures. This has created a greater sense of unity and understanding between different nations, which in turn has helped to reduce animosity, hatred, and violence.
 
 Additionally, economic globalization has helped create a stronger global economy and increased global trade. This increased economic interdependence has led to greater opportunities for collaboration and cooperation across different countries and regions. As nations are able to benefit from each other, competition has been replaced with cooperation, leading to a decrease in border tensions and other hostilities.
 
 Lastly, advances in communication and transportation technology have made it easier for people to communicate and travel, which has enabled individuals and businesses to establish meaningful relationships with people from different countries. This has created an environment of trust and collaboration, as people are more willing to work together to find solutions and promote peace. These relationships have helped reduce global tension and conflict, as countries are now more committed to reaching an agreement and promoting mutual understanding.
 
 Overall, globalization has played an important role in decreasing global tension. By increasing cultural exchanges, creating stronger economic ties, and improving communication, countries have become more open to collaboration and cooperation, leading to an overall decrease in tension and conflict.";53;1532;3040;2117;2578.5
33;essay34.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/study-school-get-job-18405/;Study at school or get a job?;"Many people believe that children should study at school to have more knowledge that prepare better for their future. Others, however, think that these children may disrupt their school work and should be allowed to leave school early to find a job. Personally, I tend to agree with the point of view that student have to be forced to study at school.
 First of all, schools offer to students a good environment with experienced professors and high quality programs for studying. It creates the best conditions for students education and can force them to focus on their school work instead of wasting their time to do useless things. Second of all, schools provide lots of academic knowledge to students. Students may learn professional skills, expand their understandings and gain experiences. Therefore, they have more opprotunities to find a job and to be successful in the future. For example, as we know, employer always prefer to hire an employee of high degree who have professional skills.
 Nevertheless, it is not unreasonable that some people think that children should interrupt their school work and get a job. Whether children can learn a lot at school, there are many subjects that will be of little value to them in the future. Furthermore, children can learn social skills when they have a job. They can get more experiences that can not be obtained at school. Working helps children be more independent and teach them to esteem and manage the money that they've earned.
 Overall, I believe that students should study at school. Even though there are some advantages of leaving school to find a job, studying at school is always the best choice for children's future. There are many ways that can train children to learn independent and social skills instead of getting a job.
";"The decision of whether to study at school or get a job is a difficult one that many young people face. On the one hand, studying at school can provide a person with the opportunity to gain knowledge and skills that will be useful in the future. On the other hand, getting a job can provide a person with the opportunity to gain experience and financial independence. Ultimately, the decision of whether to study at school or get a job should be based on a persons individual circumstances and goals.
 
 For those who are looking to gain knowledge and skills, studying at school is the best option. Attending school provides a person with the opportunity to learn from experienced teachers and to be exposed to a variety of subjects. Furthermore, studying at school can provide a person with the opportunity to network with other students and to gain valuable contacts for the future. Additionally, studying at school can provide a person with the opportunity to gain qualifications that can be used to gain employment in the future.
 
 For those who are looking to gain experience and financial independence, getting a job is the best option. Getting a job can provide a person with the opportunity to gain valuable experience in a particular field. Furthermore, getting a job can provide a person with the opportunity to gain financial independence and to learn how to manage their own money. Additionally, getting a job can provide a person with the opportunity to gain contacts and references that can be used to gain employment in the future.
 
 Ultimately, the decision of whether to study at school or get a job should be based on a persons individual circumstances and goals. For those who are looking to gain knowledge and skills, studying at school is the best option. For those who are looking to gain experience and financial independence, getting a job is the best option. Whichever option a person chooses, it is important to remember that both studying at school and getting a job can provide a person with the opportunity to gain valuable knowledge, skills, experience, and contacts that can be used to gain employment in the future.";"In todays society, young people are faced with a difficult decision when it comes to their education: should they stay in school or get a job? Both options have their respective advantages and disadvantages, and it all comes down to the individuals unique situation and circumstances that will dictate the best path to take.
 
 Staying in school is an excellent option for those who want to develop and hone their skills, knowledge, and abilities. Education is essential for achieving many of our goals and aspirations in life, and without it, it can be very difficult for a young person to reach the level of success they desire. Education also leads to better job opportunities, higher wages, and overall greater financial security in the long run.
 
 Meanwhile, leaving school and getting a job can be a great choice for those who arent interested in pursuing further education or who need to earn money more immediately. With a job, young people can start earning an income right away and gain valuable work experience that can help them later on in their careers. Furthermore, having a job can provide young people with greater financial autonomy and can free them up to pursue their interests and hobbies.
 
 Ultimately, the decision to stay in school or get a job is a personal one, and each individual must weigh their own unique circumstances and goals to determine which option is best for them. Both choices have their own individual merits and drawbacks, so it is important for young people to carefully consider their options before making a decision.";29;1794;2149;1564;1856.5
34;essay35.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/essay-high-sales-reflect-power-advertising-not-real-need-17906/;High sales reflect Power of Advertising and not the Real Need;"Nowadays, we can see advertisements everywhere, from television set to posters on the streets. Some people believe that these various advertisements get people to buy products that are unnecessary and only look good on television. I tend to agree with this view.
 To boost their sales and win over customers, companies pour a great amount of money into advertising. Most of the time, it is not about the function or quality of the commodities themselves but really the promotion of the good feeling of possessing the product. By which I mean, huge cooperation hire celebrities as the face of their product. By casting famous singers in their television advertisement, motorcycles or clothes for example, sales increase significantly since youngsters, as the target consumers, love celebrities. Since having these products shows their status, the quality obviously is not relatively important.
 However, despite the fact that advertisements can be falseful and exaggerated, it is also true that it plays and important role economically. They introduce new products, and provide various choices, not to mention they are often visually enjoyable, since they aim to grab your attention. Advertising also helps to keep prices at reasonable levels, creates a fair environment for commercial competition. Otherwise the market may be monopolistic, and the price as well as the choice will not be so selective.
 The power of advertising maybe over-rated, we can not deny that the final decision is on the hands of us consumers. No matter how appealing the advertisements are, we should be able to make the decision on our own.
";"Advertising has become an integral part of our lives. It is everywhere, from television to radio, newspapers, magazines, billboards, and even the internet. Advertising has become so pervasive that it is difficult to imagine life without it. But does high sales really reflect the power of advertising and not the real need?
 
 Advertising can be a powerful tool for companies to increase their sales. It can create a sense of urgency and desire for a product or service. Companies use advertising to create a need for their product or service, even if the need is not real. They use persuasive language, attractive visuals, and catchy slogans to create a desire for their product. Advertising can also be used to create a false sense of urgency, making consumers feel like they need to buy the product right away.
 
 However, high sales do not necessarily reflect the power of advertising and not the real need. Consumers may be influenced by advertising, but ultimately they make their own decisions about what to buy. Consumers may be swayed by advertising, but they still need to feel that the product or service is something they need or want. If the product or service does not meet their needs, they will not buy it.
 
 Advertising can be a powerful tool for companies to increase their sales, but it is not the only factor. Companies need to ensure that their product or service meets the needs of their customers. They need to provide quality products and services, as well as good customer service. Companies also need to ensure that their advertising is honest and accurate, so that consumers can make informed decisions.
 
 In conclusion, high sales do not necessarily reflect the power of advertising and not the real need. Advertising can be a powerful tool for companies to increase their sales, but it is not the only factor. Companies need to ensure that their product or service meets the needs of their customers, and that their advertising is honest and accurate. Ultimately, consumers make their own decisions about what to buy, and if the product or service does not meet their needs, they will not buy it.";"Advertising is a powerful tool which companies use to boost their sales and establish brand loyalty. It is often used to create an artificial need for products or services, convincing potential customers to purchase items that they otherwise would not need or want. While high sales may be indicative of the power of advertising, it does not necessarily demonstrate that the product has a real need in society.
 
 Advertising is designed to create an artificial need in potential customers. Companies will use persuasive language and visual images to capture the attention of potential buyers and to create a sense of urgency in purchasing the product. Through advertising, companies can manipulate the public by creating false desires or needs for the product which they would not have had previously. This is why effective advertising campaigns are so successful at generating sales, regardless of whether there is a real need for the product or not.
 
 On the other hand, a truly successful product should have a real need in society which allows it to generate sales without the need for advertising. The product should be designed to solve an existing problem or provide a service which people are actively seeking. Companies that make products which meet real needs in society often do not need to spend money on advertising to drive sales, as word of mouth recommendations and customer loyalty often leads to repeat business.
 
 In conclusion, while advertising is a powerful tool which companies use to boost their sales, the success of a product should not be measured solely by the number of sales it generates. Instead, a product should have a real need in society in order to be truly successful. High sales may be indicative of the power of advertising, but it does not necessarily demonstrate that the product has a real need in society.";61;1618;2127;1851;1989.0
35;essay36.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/essay-gun-contral-17874/;Gun control;"Gun is definitely not a kind of normal good in our society, which is strictly controlled in most countries. However, gun control in some countries is relatively loose than others. Therefore, this is still a controversial topic around the world. From my point of view, it is sensible to enforce the gun control.
 The first factor considered is the risk of accidents with guns. The accidents cannot be completely avoided although only those who have gun licenses can purchase guns. For example, we hear some news from time to time that someone was hurt by accident during the hunting. So the fewer guns possessed, the fewer accidents would happened, our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates.
 Secondly, most violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns, especially in some countries where guns are available for people. Eventually, guns will create a violent society if the trend continues. Take an example, in American, young adults and even juveniles can get access to guns, which leads to the tragedies of school gun shooting. What is worse, some terrorists are able to possess more advanced weapons than the police, which makes citizens always live in danger.
 Thirdly, the possession of guns can also raise the rates of suicide. In the US, firearms remain the most common method of suicide, accounting for about 50 per cent. Unfortunately, there is an increasing trend of adolescent suicides and suicides among those age 75 and over.
 In conclusion, considering the rise in accident rates, violent crime rates and suicide rates, I support that the guns should be strictly limited and the government should enforce a series of laws to prevent our societies from violence.
";"Gun control is a highly debated topic in the United States, with many people arguing for and against the regulation of firearms. Proponents of gun control argue that it is necessary to reduce the number of gun-related deaths and injuries, while opponents argue that gun control infringes on the Second Amendment right to bear arms. This essay will explore both sides of the argument and will ultimately conclude that gun control is necessary to protect the safety of citizens.
 
 The first argument in favor of gun control is that it reduces gun-related deaths and injuries. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were 39,773 gun-related deaths in the United States in 2017. This number is far too high, and it is clear that something needs to be done to reduce it. Gun control measures such as background checks, waiting periods, and bans on certain types of weapons have been shown to reduce gun-related deaths and injuries. These measures can help to ensure that only responsible, law-abiding citizens are able to purchase firearms.
 
 The second argument in favor of gun control is that it can help to reduce crime. Studies have shown that areas with stricter gun control laws have lower rates of gun-related crime. This is because criminals are less likely to commit crimes if they know that their victims are less likely to be armed. Gun control laws can also help to reduce the number of stolen firearms, as they make it more difficult for criminals to obtain guns.
 
 The third argument in favor of gun control is that it can help to reduce mass shootings. Mass shootings are a growing problem in the United States, and they have become increasingly common in recent years. Stricter gun control laws can help to reduce the number of mass shootings by making it more difficult for potential shooters to obtain firearms.
 
 The final argument in favor of gun control is that it can help to protect the Second Amendment right to bear arms. While opponents of gun control argue that it infringes on this right, the truth is that gun control measures can actually help to protect it. By ensuring that only responsible, law-abiding citizens are able to purchase firearms, gun control laws can help to ensure that the Second Amendment right is not abused.
 
 In conclusion, gun control is necessary to protect the safety of citizens. It can help to reduce gun-related deaths and injuries, reduce crime, reduce mass shootings, and protect the Second Amendment right to bear arms. For these reasons, it is clear that gun control is an important and necessary measure.";"Gun control is an ongoing and highly controversial debate in the United States. The debate has been further fueled in recent years by numerous tragic mass shootings. Both sides of the debate put forward a number of arguments to defend their position. Those who are in favor of gun control argue that there is simply too much violence in society, and that stricter gun control laws are needed in order to reduce it. Proponents of gun control also point to the dangers posed to society by the proliferation of firearms, as well as the fact that guns are very easily obtainable. On the other hand, those opposed to gun control claim that it violates the right of citizens to bear arms, and that it does not do enough to address the root causes of gun violence, such as poverty and mental health issues.
 
 Whichever side of the argument one leans towards, it is apparent that the current level of gun violence in the US is a serious issue, and something needs to be done to address it. One possible solution is to implement tighter regulations on gun ownership, such as thorough background checks and restrictions on the types of guns that can be legally owned. This would likely help reduce the number of guns available for purchase, as well as make it more difficult for dangerous individuals to obtain them. Similarly, there should be better enforcement of existing gun laws, as well as laws designed to tackle illegal gun trafficking. This could help reduce the number of guns available on the black market.
 
 At the same time, it is important to address the issues underlying gun violence. This necessitates improving mental health services and addressing social problems such as poverty and inequality. By providing more funding and resources to these areas, it is possible to reduce the risk of people seeking out guns as a means to solve their problems.
 
 In conclusion, gun control is a highly contentious issue in the US. While it is important to implement tighter regulations on gun ownership, it is also necessary to tackle the underlying issues that lead to gun violence. With a focus on both of these areas, it is possible to reduce the level of gun violence in the US and make society a safer place for everyone.";11;1694;2594;2226;2410.0
36;essay37.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/writing-international-sporting-occasions-help-ease-17729/;International sporting occasions help to ease international tensions;"International sporting events are a good change to create a multi-nation community of fans having the same passion. It will help people around the world understand each other more. Since, international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way.
 An international sporting event is normal held in a country with huge interest from fans all over the world. For the time of occasions, people regardless of nationality, origin and religion will live together. People can understand more about a country, it is useful to ease tensions between nations. For example in FIFA World Cup 2010, the relation between North Korea and South Korea is dangerous for the warship sinking. The world suspected North Korea of the aggressive action. However, due to this event North Korea showed a friendship and enthuasism. It is rare times when people can learn about this country. It really help to alleviate the tension.
 Besides easing tensions, an international sporting event also helps fans release patriotic emotions in a safe way.

Everythings is created by patriotic emotions of Chinese who wanted to bring a beautiful China to the world.
 In conclusion, International sporting events will draw the international concern. It will make the world more peaceful by easing internation tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way.
";"International sporting occasions have long been seen as a way to ease international tensions. This is because they provide a platform for countries to come together and compete in a friendly and peaceful manner. Through these events, countries can show their respect for each other and build bridges between cultures.
 
 The Olympic Games are the most well-known example of international sporting events. Since their inception in 1896, the Olympic Games have been a symbol of peace and unity. Countries from all over the world come together to compete in a variety of sports, and the Olympic spirit of friendship and fair play is evident throughout. The Olympic Games also provide a platform for countries to showcase their culture and traditions, and to learn from each other.
 
 Other international sporting events, such as the FIFA World Cup, the Rugby World Cup, and the Cricket World Cup, also provide a platform for countries to come together and compete in a peaceful and respectful manner. These events are a great way for countries to show their respect for each other and to build bridges between cultures.
 
 International sporting events can also help to ease international tensions by providing a distraction from the political and economic issues that often divide countries. By focusing on the competition, countries can put aside their differences and come together in a spirit of friendly competition. This can help to foster a sense of understanding and respect between countries, and can help to reduce the tensions that often arise between them.
 
 In conclusion, international sporting events can be a powerful tool for easing international tensions. They provide a platform for countries to come together and compete in a friendly and peaceful manner, and can help to foster a sense of understanding and respect between countries. By focusing on the competition, countries can put aside their differences and come together in a spirit of friendly competition, which can help to reduce the tensions that often arise between them.";"International sporting occasions, such as the Olympic Games, have long been seen as a way to bring people together, regardless of nationality. While some may argue that these games merely divert attention away from international tensions, there is evidence to suggest that they can also help to ease such tensions, as they bring countries and individuals with different beliefs together in a spirit of harmony and friendship.
 
 The Olympic Games, for example, have been around for centuries, and have long been used as a way to promote peace and unity among countries with diverse cultures, religions and political views. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has always taken the view that sport should be used as a means to improve understanding among nations, and the Olympic Games have been a major tool in this effort. For example, two countries which were at war managed to briefly put aside their differences to attend the 1956 Olympic Games in Melbourne, Australia, and these two countries, who had otherwise been hostile towards each other, managed to join forces in a spirit of cooperation and friendship.
 
 International sporting events can also serve as a platform for people from different parts of the world to come together and celebrate their common interests. For example, when the Soccer World Cup is held, countries from all over the world, regardless of their political, religious or cultural differences, come together in support of their respective teams. This type of event allows for individuals to experience the spirit of camaraderie and togetherness, which can help to reduce tensions between countries.
 
 International sporting events can also provide a platform for individuals to assert their individual identities and to express themselves. This can be particularly useful in cases where a country has experienced a period of political division or a clash of ideologies. When such individuals come together to celebrate their common interests in the form of a sporting event, it helps to rebuild bridges between different groups, and this can be an important way to reduce tensions which can lead to conflict.
 
 In conclusion, international sporting occasions can be an effective tool to help reduce international tensions. These events help to bring people from different parts of the world together in a spirit of friendship and understanding, and can serve as a platform for individuals to express their identities. International sporting events can also remind us of our common humanity and can provide a space for us to come together and celebrate our common interests, regardless of our political or cultural differences.";68;2101;2050;2666;2358.0
37;essay38.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/graduate-essays-4/essay-technology-widen-gap-between-rich-poor-21056/;technology that widen the gap between rich and poor?;"Technology, in the past two hundred years, has taken a dramatic progress in many fields of our society, such as telecommunications, manufacturing and buildings, etc. Certainly, technologies have also contributed to the great change of our daily lives. However, today some people consider that the range of technology regarding of public has a negative effect on increasing the gap between rich and poor. Personally, I find it hard for me to agree with this opinion by the following reasons.
 In the first instance, the progress of material technology leads to the sharp fall of price of a great number of products. About ten years ago, mobile phones ware very expensive for most members of my country, only a few of rich individuals have enough money to buy one. Today, mobile phones become a common one of household items, which due to the cheaper materials and better producing technologies. Thus, most members of our society can benefit from the consequences of technical advancements, especially the poor people.
 Secondly, technical developments improve productivity, which help people to escape from daily chores, and invest more time and energy in studying and living a more meaningful life. With the development of Internet, we can enjoy the pleasure and conveniences which it brings about for us every day. In the past time, we had to spend a lot of time searching information and waiting for letters of our friends who lived far away from us. Nowadays, we can talk with our friends online, no matter where we are and how far between us. In addition, the Internet gives everyone access to the same information, this therefore leads to greater equality between individuals.
 Undoubtedly, everything has two sides and technology is not an exception. To some extent, the gap between rich people and poor is widen by technology, because only the rich people have ability to afford the expensive high-tech products, and these products can help them to earn more in return.
 Nevertheless, I think it is a limp opposition to the remarkable advantages of technology, and technology is not the root cause of the gap.
 In conclusion, the good technology bringing to us is undeniable. Under proper use of technology, the human being can be benefit a lot and perpetually from the advancement of it.
";"Technology has been a major factor in widening the gap between the rich and the poor. In todays world, technology has become an integral part of our lives, and it has been used to create a two-tiered society. The wealthy have access to the latest technology, while the poor are left behind.
 
 The rich have the resources to purchase the latest technology, such as computers, smartphones, and tablets. They can use these devices to access the internet, which provides them with a wealth of information and resources. They can use the internet to find jobs, research investments, and stay up-to-date on the latest news and trends. This gives them an advantage over the poor, who may not have access to the same resources.
 
 The wealthy also have access to the latest technology in terms of healthcare. They can afford to purchase the latest medical treatments and medications, while the poor may not have access to the same level of care. This creates a huge gap in terms of health outcomes between the rich and the poor.
 
 Technology has also been used to create a digital divide. The wealthy have access to high-speed internet, while the poor may not have access to the same level of service. This creates a gap in terms of access to information and resources. The wealthy can use the internet to find jobs, research investments, and stay up-to-date on the latest news and trends, while the poor may not have access to the same level of information.
 
 Technology has also been used to create a gap in terms of education. The wealthy can afford to send their children to the best schools, while the poor may not have access to the same level of education. This creates a gap in terms of educational outcomes between the rich and the poor.
 
 In conclusion, technology has been a major factor in widening the gap between the rich and the poor. The wealthy have access to the latest technology, while the poor are left behind. They have access to the latest healthcare, digital resources, and educational opportunities, while the poor may not have access to the same level of resources. This creates a huge gap between the rich and the poor, and it is a major issue that needs to be addressed.";"The evolution of technology has been a blessing to mankind in many ways. It has increased efficiency and convenience in almost every aspect of life. However, it has also widened the gap between the rich and poor in significant ways.
 
 At its simplest level, technology gives the wealthy access to information and opportunities that are simply not available to the poor. For example, those who can afford the latest computers, smart phones, and tablets have access to world-class education, online job listings, and competitive markets. As such, these individuals are better able to expand their wealth, knowledge, and influence.
 
 Meanwhile, those with less economic power are limited in what they can access. Fewer resources mean limited information, which in turn makes climbing out of poverty even more difficult. In addition, technology can be used to manipulate markets and control prices, which disadvantages those without the financial clout to influence the market.
 
 The digital divide is real, and it is increasingly becoming a major factor in exacerbating economic inequality. Technology can serve as a barrier to social mobility and perpetuate existing inequalities. The internet and its associated technology has vastly increased the speed of communication, commerce and networking but it is only available to those who can afford it.
 
 In addition, technologies such as automation are rapidly displacing human labor, leading to job losses that disproportionately affect the poor. This is especially true in the Global South, where basic infrastructure is often inadequate to support technological advancements.
 
 In conclusion, technology has the potential to bridge the gap between the wealthy and the poor, but it is also a powerful tool used to increase inequality. Those with access to the latest technologies are at an advantage in almost every aspect of life, while those with fewer resources are left to struggle. To truly level the playing field, access to technology must be universally available and affordable.";52;2296;2194;2040;2117.0
38;essay39.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/why-should-human-beings-travel-outer-space-20952/;Why should human beings travel to outer space?;"For many centuries, outer space has been one of the most favourable realms of study. Space expeditions have been launched and many have been successful. However, a lot of people still consider space exploration as an act of wasting money, to illustrate, astronauts only brought useless rocks back to planet earth despite the large sum of money spent on their equipment. On the other hand, there are some reasons for human beings to travel to outer space.
 Firstly, many facts about solar system can be discovered. For instance, a picture of planet earth proved that the earth is round, not flat. Another example is that it is the earth which goes around the sun, not vice versa. If it was not for the space exploration, we would never know these facts.
 Secondly, people can know more about the planet earth itself. By observing planet earth from outer space, people can find out ample things for example about the atmosphere of the planet earth. With this knowledge, people can work on something to prevent earth hazards such as global warming.
 Finally, a great deal of sophisticated technology can be invented. As astronauts need to travel to outer space which does not have any oxygen to breathe in, scientists are compelled to do research on the oxygen tanks. Oxygen tanks, for instance, are proved useful not only in outer space but also underwater. Moreover, spaceships, communication satellites and space pens also contribute a lot to the society.
 As a conclusion, I personally think that human beings should travel to outer space. In spite of costing a fortune, space exploration has given aforementioned benefits.
";"Humans have always been fascinated by the unknown, and the exploration of outer space is no exception. Space exploration has been a source of inspiration and curiosity for centuries, and the potential benefits of space travel are numerous. From the scientific discoveries that could be made to the potential for economic growth, there are many reasons why human beings should travel to outer space.
 
 First and foremost, space exploration provides an opportunity for scientific discovery. By venturing into the unknown, humans can gain a better understanding of the universe and the laws that govern it. Through space exploration, scientists can learn more about the origins of the universe, the formation of planets, and the potential for life on other worlds. Additionally, space exploration can provide valuable insight into the effects of gravity, radiation, and other environmental factors on living organisms. By studying these phenomena, scientists can gain a better understanding of how to protect humans from the dangers of space.
 
 Second, space exploration can provide economic benefits. By launching satellites and other spacecraft, countries can gain access to valuable resources such as minerals, energy, and water. Additionally, space exploration can open up new markets for products and services, such as space tourism and the sale of space-based technology. Finally, space exploration can create jobs and stimulate economic growth in countries that invest in the technology.
 
 Finally, space exploration can provide a sense of hope and inspiration. By exploring the unknown, humans can gain a better understanding of their place in the universe and their potential for the future. Additionally, space exploration can provide a sense of unity and cooperation among nations, as countries work together to explore the universe.
 
 In conclusion, there are many reasons why human beings should travel to outer space. From the potential for scientific discovery to the economic benefits, space exploration can provide a wealth of opportunities for humans. Additionally, space exploration can provide a sense of hope and inspiration for the future. For these reasons, human beings should continue to explore the unknown and push the boundaries of space exploration.";"Human beings have been exploring the unknown since the dawn of time, and one of the most mysterious and exciting frontiers today is outer space. Traveling to outer space has the potential to yield great benefits for both humanity and the planet, and it is therefore imperative that human beings strive to make space exploration a reality.
 
 The first reason why humans should travel to outer space is that it could drastically improve life on Earth. Space exploration leads to advancements in science and technology. As space technology and exploration continue, astronauts and scientists gain more experience and understanding of the universe around them. This knowledge can then be applied to our own planet, leading to solutions to many of the world's most pressing problems. For instance, developing new energy sources, understanding climate change, or mastering the production of food in a sustainable manner, are all ways in which space exploration could benefit us here on Earth.
 
 Another reason to explore outer space is that it could help us find answers to some of the biggest questions that have plagued us since the dawn of time. From the beginning of civilization, we have asked questions such as Where did we come from?, What is our purpose?, and Is there life beyond Earth?. Space exploration is the only way to answer these questions and gain new insight into the universe that we inhabit. By traveling to other planets, galaxies, and stars, we can better understand our place in the universe and learn more about our past, present, and future.
 
 Finally, space exploration is an important opportunity to preserve the human race. Through space exploration we can find new planets and cosmic bodies that may be capable of hosting life, and with this new knowledge, we can create backup homes for the future of humanity. In the event of a catastrophic event on Earth, or if a major global crisis occurs, having a Plan B in outer space could save the human race.
 
 In conclusion, it is clear that space exploration can bring many benefits to our planet and to the human race as a whole. By traveling to outer space, we can improve our lives here on Earth, find answers to some of our greatest questions, and potentially save the human race in a crisis. Therefore, it is crucial that humans prioritize space exploration, in order to ensure a bright future for our planet and our species.";46;1625;2279;2404;2341.5

40;essay41.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/benefits-students-unpaid-work-20722/;Benefits of students' unpaid work;"The purpose of this essay is to discuss what can students and the organizations benefit from the activity that the students sent by their schools to work for companies without salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the advantages for doing this for both students and companies, and then I would draw a conclusion at the end.
 To begin with, students can learn invaluable experiences through the period of time working for the institutions they are assigned to. In most school curriculums, the courses are theoretical and often by instructors speaking to students sitting in the classroom. As a result, students might have little idea of the real challenges or the true situation when they enter the workforce after graduation. For this reason, the internship, although without pay, can give them the experiences that money cannot buy.
 As for the companies, the unpaid interns can no doubt save some money. In addition, the younger generations can help them generate new ideas as the students are not bound to restricted workload and they tend to have greater imagination, which can be essentially helpful when they are making a new advertisement or slogan. Moreover they can start looking for potential employees and begin the training, therefore save the time and resources for searching new staffs and organizing an orientation.
 To sum up, students can learn outside the textbook and classroom with a real working experiences that can be a great opportunity for future job consideration whereas organizations earn much more as they can not only save time and money but also be enlightened by what young people have to say.
";"The concept of unpaid work for students is a controversial one, with some arguing that it should be encouraged and others arguing that it should be avoided. However, there are a number of benefits to students undertaking unpaid work, which should not be overlooked.
 
 Firstly, unpaid work can provide students with valuable experience in a particular field. This can be especially beneficial for those who are considering a career in the same field, as it can give them an insight into the industry and help them to decide if it is the right path for them. It can also help to build their skills and knowledge in the area, which can be useful when applying for jobs or further study.
 
 Secondly, unpaid work can provide students with the opportunity to network and make connections with people in the industry. This can be invaluable in helping them to find employment or further study opportunities in the future. It can also help them to build relationships with potential employers, which can be beneficial when applying for jobs.
 
 Thirdly, unpaid work can provide students with the opportunity to gain a better understanding of the industry and the wider world. This can be especially beneficial for those who are considering a career in the field, as it can give them a better understanding of the industry and the challenges it faces. It can also help them to develop a better understanding of the wider world, which can be beneficial in their future career.
 
 Finally, unpaid work can provide students with the opportunity to develop their skills and knowledge in a particular field.

 In conclusion, there are a number of benefits to students undertaking unpaid work, which should not be overlooked. It can provide them with valuable experience, the opportunity to network and make connections, a better understanding of the industry and the wider world, and the opportunity to develop their skills and knowledge in the field.";"Unpaid student work can be a beneficial experience for students and their future careers. By working in an unpaid, unskilled or volunteer capacity, students can gain invaluable skills, insight and experience to improve their own lives, communities and future job prospects.
 
 Unpaid student work provides students with the opportunity to gain real-world experience, which is invaluable for future job success. By working for free, students gain insight into how businesses operate, how to interact with colleagues and customers, how to manage their time, how to take on responsibility, how to problem solve and how to work independently. Learning entrepreneurial skills such as marketing and sales through unpaid internships and volunteering can also help a student gain more knowledge of the business world. These skills are invaluable for success in future job searches and interviews.
 
 Unpaid student work can also help students develop employability skills, such as communication and teamwork, which are important for many jobs. Through unpaid student work, students learn how to collaborate with others, present their ideas clearly, ask for help and accept constructive criticism. By working in a team environment, students also hone their leadership skills, build their confidence and learn how to take initiative. These skills are invaluable for any job a student pursues and can help them stand out from other applicants.
 
 Moreover, working in an unpaid capacity can also provide students with real-world problem-solving skills. Through internships, volunteer work and other opportunities, students are presented with a wide range of problem-solving scenarios. These scenarios can help them understand how to approach and overcome challenging tasks, as well as how to think outside of the box.

41;essay42.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/paying-more-money-only-motivation-make-employees-work-harder-20711/;Paying more money is the only motivation to make employees work harder;"The purpose of this essay is to discuss whether or not the only way to motivate employees to be more hard-working and productive is by raising their salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the factors for higher yields and finish by stating my position on this.
 A raise or a promotion can no doubt increase the morale in the working places. Workers understand they have to work harder to meet the boss' expectations and to make themselves worthwhile. For instance, junior high school teachers have great responsibility not only for students' private lives as they are going through adolescence but also their school work due to the fact that it is an important phase for them to study hard and get into the high school they want. If the teachers receive higher salaries, they will be willing to spend more extra time mentoring the youngsters rather than hoping they learn in cram schools and so forth, as this is what is happening in Taiwan.
 Nevertheless, I believe that creating an enjoyable working environment is more realistic and essential if one wishes an increase in productivity and better employee performances. Take Google for example, the company offers recreation rooms and extra personal leaves for their workers to develop a more relaxing and supportive workforce. By doing this, the employers can make sure the employees can actually focus and concentrate on their projects instead of thinking about their children or feeling pressured.
 To sum up, I believe that a higher pay can be one of the incentive if were to encourage harder-working employees. Alternatively, providing a more secured and relaxing environment for workers can fundamentally boost their productivity since they will be feeling more cared for and therefore do their best for their bosses.
";"Paying more money is often seen as the only way to motivate employees to work harder. While it is true that money is a powerful motivator, it is not the only one. In fact, there are many other factors that can be used to motivate employees to work harder.
 
 The first factor is recognition. Employees want to feel appreciated for their hard work and dedication. Acknowledging their efforts and giving them recognition for their accomplishments can be a powerful motivator. This can be done through verbal praise, awards, or other forms of recognition.
 
 The second factor is job satisfaction. Employees who are satisfied with their job and feel that their work is meaningful are more likely to work harder. This can be achieved by providing employees with challenging tasks and opportunities to grow and develop.
 
 The third factor is a sense of ownership. Employees who feel that they have ownership in the company and their work are more likely to be motivated to work hard. This can be achieved by giving employees a sense of autonomy and allowing them to take ownership of their work.
 
 The fourth factor is a sense of purpose. Employees who feel that their work has a purpose and that it is making a difference are more likely to be motivated to work hard. This can be achieved by providing employees with meaningful work and a sense of purpose.
 
 Finally, the fifth factor is a supportive work environment. Employees who feel supported and valued by their colleagues and supervisors are more likely to be motivated to work hard. This can be achieved by creating a positive work environment and providing employees with the resources and support they need to succeed.
 
 In conclusion, while money is a powerful motivator, it is not the only one. There are many other factors that can be used to motivate employees to work harder. Recognition, job satisfaction, a sense of ownership, a sense of purpose, and a supportive work environment are all important factors that can be used to motivate employees to work harder.";"The debate about whether paying more money is the only motivation for employees to work harder has been a topic of contention for some time. While financial incentives can be a strong motivator, there are other factors that can also play a role in inspiring employees to put in their best effort.
 
 The most obvious reason that paying more money can motivate employees to work harder is because of the associated reward. Money is a universal currency, and when employees are provided more of it, they may be naturally more driven and task-oriented. On the other hand, people can also be motivated by feeling rewarded, valued, and appreciated. For example, a person may be more invested in their job if they receive bonuses or other tangible forms of recognition rather than just an increase in their salary.
 
 No matter what the incentives are, there needs to be a clear understanding of the expectations that come along with the rewards. When employees are given explicit guidance on what is expected of them to receive a raise or bonus, they are more likely to work hard to meet the standards. In addition, employees should receive feedback and recognition on a regular basis. Acknowledging an employee's contribution encourages further investment in the job and results in sustained positivity.
 
 Ultimately, paying more money is not the only motivation for employees to work harder. While money can be beneficial, employees also need to feel like their work is valued and recognized. By providing a mix of incentives, employers can create a workplace that is inspirational and stimulating for everyone.";70;1789;2028;1609;1818.5
42;essay43.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/sporting-events-easing-international-tensions-releasing-20060/;Sporting events easing international tensions, releasing patriotic feelings;"For most folks on Earth, the need to gather in one place, and enjoy competition with other talented people from different cultures through popular games has always been a strong motivation. This trend is so deeply engraved in people's mind that the organisation of such events continue to be planned, even when some participants are facing grievous social problems. It is agreed that large scale sports games make people focus on attractive contests instead of international disputes, and help them being proud of their nation. This will be proved by analysing how sports events may be an important link to the peace, and by how they encourage people to display their national symbols.
 Firstly, during times of war, people living in badly affected countries can forget about the gloomy environment and maintain a link with the rest of the world by listening to international sports event. For example, when Irak was hardly struck by the Second Gulf War, its citizens tried to catch any incoming news about the FootballWorld Cup through their portable receivers. This clearly shows that international sports competitions encourage people and put pressure on them to come back, sooner or later, to a relative peaceful normality. Thus, world sports events strongly participate in eventually pulling back people towards friendship and peace.
 Secondly, these sporting occasions are a good opportunity for people to be proud of their country. For instance, when the Football World Cup was organised in South Africa, its citizens filled up the stadiums, cheered and waved national flags to support their national team on the field. South African national and traditional songs were played in the streets throughout the night. This example demonstrates how people might take numerous elements from their roots and history to proudly display them while supporting their team. As a result, it is clear that people can freely express their patriotic feelings during international sports events.
 In conclusion, after analysing the effects of world games both for countries at war and for organising countries, it is clear that they not only constitute a tremendous appeal towards a peaceful society, but also guide the public demonstrations of national proudness. This has been true for centuries and will certainly not change in the foreseeable future.
";"Sporting events have long been a source of entertainment and a way to bring people together. In recent years, however, they have also become a powerful tool for easing international tensions and releasing patriotic feelings. From the Olympics to the World Cup, sporting events have become a way for countries to come together and celebrate their shared love of sport.
 
 The Olympics, in particular, have been a powerful force in easing international tensions. The Olympic Games are a time when countries from around the world come together to compete in a spirit of friendly competition. This spirit of camaraderie and sportsmanship can help to bridge the gap between countries that may have been at odds in the past. The Olympic Games also provide a platform for countries to showcase their culture and national pride. This can help to foster a sense of unity and understanding between countries that may have been at odds in the past.
 
 The World Cup is another example of a sporting event that can help to ease international tensions. The World Cup is a time when countries from around the world come together to celebrate their shared love of soccer. The World Cup also provides a platform for countries to showcase their culture and national pride. This can help to foster a sense of unity and understanding between countries that may have been at odds in the past.
 
 Sporting events can also be a powerful tool for releasing patriotic feelings. The Olympics and the World Cup are both times when countries come together to celebrate their national pride. This can help to foster a sense of unity and patriotism among citizens of different countries. This can help to create a sense of solidarity and pride in ones country, which can help to ease international tensions.
 
 In conclusion, sporting events have become a powerful tool for easing international tensions and releasing patriotic feelings. The Olympics and the World Cup are both times when countries come together to celebrate their shared love of sport and to showcase their culture and national pride. This can help to foster a sense of unity and understanding between countries that may have been at odds in the past. Sporting events can also be a powerful tool for releasing patriotic feelings, as they provide a platform for citizens of different countries to come together and celebrate their national pride.";"Sports are no longer just about running, dribbling and kicking a ball. They have become much more than that. They have become a way for people to come together in celebration of their nations culture and a symbol of its unity and pride. Sporting events have become an integral part in easing international tensions, releasing patriotic feelings and promoting peace between countries.
 
 International tensions arise from a variety of sources such as political, economic, social and cultural issues. The participation of countries in sport provides an opportunity to come together, to celebrate each others cultures and values and to lay the foundations for peace. Sporting events can provide a platform for dialogue between nations and an environment to build relationships that could not be achieved through diplomacy alone. For example, the Olympic Games have become an international sports event in which countries from all over the world come together to compete and demonstrate their national pride. Through the spirit of sportsmanship, the Olympics symbolize the idea of understanding and acceptance of different cultures and nationalities.
 
 Sporting events also release patriotic feelings of pride and optimism for a nations population. During times of crisis, people look to their national sports teams for inspiration. For example, the 2014 World Cup saw millions of Brazilians come together in support of the national team, helping to improve the countrys image and morale even during a difficult and divided political period. Similarly, the 2008 Beijing Olympics served as a catalyst for increased patriotism amongst the citizens of China, inspiring them to take pride in their nation and its achievements.
 
 Overall, sporting events are a powerful tool for peacebuilding and promotion of national unity. They provide an opportunity for countries to come together, to celebrate their differences and to build relationships. Through the release of patriotic feelings and aspirations, sports help to bring nations together and to create a more harmonious international environment.";75;2345;2384;2093;2238.5
43;essay44.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/government-should-make-more-effort-promote-alternative-19772/;Government should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy;"The increasing population and the technological advancements demand more energy than in the past. It is believed that there are various other resources such as the nuclear and solar which are abundant and eco-friendly. I will analyze these areas in the essay.
 Firstly, the major source of energy today is water. Although there is a lot of water shortage to generate electricity many countries still rely only on this source. To generate such a vast energy the fundamental resources are falling short. Thus, during summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India. If the government encourage the use of nuclear, solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity. Therefore, it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources.
 Secondly, the sources most widely used currently to generate power releases extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere which increases global warming. For example, the use of a solar cooker instead of an electric cooker would certainly reduce the global warming. In the same way, the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to the hydro-kinetic energy causes less atmospheric pollution.
 To conclude, it would be a better implication by the government to promote other sources of energy. This can make use of the available natural resources which in turn would reduce the global warming. Further, government should motivate and encourage the people to use alternative sources such as the solar and the nuclear energy.
";"The world is facing an energy crisis. Fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, are the primary sources of energy used to power our homes, businesses, and transportation systems. Unfortunately, these sources are finite and are rapidly being depleted. In addition, burning fossil fuels releases pollutants into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming and climate change. To address these issues, governments should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy.
 
 Alternative sources of energy, such as solar, wind, and geothermal, are renewable and do not produce pollutants. Solar energy is generated by capturing the suns rays and converting them into electricity. Wind energy is generated by harnessing the power of the wind to turn turbines and generate electricity. Geothermal energy is generated by tapping into the Earths natural heat to generate electricity. All of these sources of energy are clean and renewable, and can help reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.
 
 In order to promote alternative sources of energy, governments should provide incentives for individuals and businesses to invest in renewable energy sources. This could include tax credits, grants, and other financial incentives. Governments should also invest in research and development of renewable energy technologies, such as solar panels, wind turbines, and geothermal systems. This will help make these technologies more affordable and accessible to the public.
 
 Finally, governments should educate the public about the benefits of renewable energy sources. This could include public service announcements, school programs, and other initiatives to raise awareness of the importance of renewable energy. By educating the public, governments can help create a culture of sustainability and encourage people to make the switch to renewable energy sources.
 
 In conclusion, governments should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy. Renewable energy sources are clean, renewable, and can help reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. Governments should provide incentives for individuals and businesses to invest in renewable energy sources, invest in research and development of renewable energy technologies, and educate the public about the benefits of renewable energy sources. By taking these steps, governments can help create a more sustainable future for our planet.";"For centuries, humanity has relied heavily on burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas to meet its energy needs. While these sources of energy remain the mainstay, their reliance has come at a great environmental and economic cost. Climate change is real and it's up to the government to take the lead in promoting alternative energy sources if our planet is to be saved from the disastrous effects of global warming. 
 
 The most obvious alternative is to move from an economy based on fossil fuels to one based on renewable sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower. These sources are clean, renewable, and have the additional benefit of reducing costs in the long run. Governments can provide financial incentives to people and organizations that install solar panels and other renewable energy sources. This could include rebates for the installation and operational costs, as well as incentives for individuals and organizations that produce their own electricity. Governments can also enact laws to ensure that all new buildings and homes are constructed to use renewable energy sources. 
 
 In addition, governments around the world can promote greater efficiency in the way we use energy. By instituting laws that require all new buildings and appliances to meet higher efficiency standards, governments can help reduce energy use, save money, and reduce emissions. Governments can also encourage the research and development of technologies that are better able to harness and store renewable energy, such as storing solar energy in batteries.
 
 Finally, the government can educate the public on the benefits of using alternative forms of energy. By raising the public's awareness of the consequences of fossil fuels, governments can encourage individuals and businesses to switch to renewable energy sources. This could include incentives for businesses that install solar panels and other renewable energy sources, as well as energy efficiency campaigns for households. 
 
 In conclusion, it is clear that the government has an important role to play in promoting alternative energy sources. By providing incentives for individuals and businesses, by enacting energy efficiency laws, and by educating the public, governments can make a real difference in our efforts to reduce emissions and combat climate change.";75;1583;2405;2342;2373.5
44;essay45.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/gt-should-governments-responsible-help-unemployed-homeless-40169/;Should governments be responsible to help the unemployed and homeless;"Unemployment is clearly a global problem, be it in developed countries or developing ones. However, I tend to believe it is the responsibility of these disadvantaged citizens, rather than the government, to help them out.
 Government money should be spent on publicly benefitial programs only. Tax revenue is collected from those who works. Spending them on helping those not make contribution to society would not sound fair to tax payers. Besides, there are other pressing demands on the government expenditure, such as health care service and education, so addressing unemployment should have low priority.
 Also, it is obvious that, to survive in this competitive world, one has to work hard and equip themselves well. If they could get free financial help from the government, they might end up with out any motivation to work at all.
 Of course, this does not mean we should leave alone those who do need assistance. They are already in reverse circumstances and it would be rather difficult for them to overcome the difficulties without external support. In this case, the government ought to set up free vocational trainings or to provide interest-free bank loans for them, so that they can have the chance to get back to work. After all, it is benefitial to the society as a whole when the jobless can make contribution again.
 In conclusion, my point of view is that, although the government should provide help for the disadvantaged people, direct financial support may not be a wise option and people should rely on themselves to get out of the adversity.
";"The issue of unemployment and homelessness is a pressing one in many countries around the world. Governments have a responsibility to help the unemployed and homeless, as they are the ones who are most vulnerable and in need of assistance. Governments should provide support in the form of job training, job placement, and housing assistance.
 
 Job training is an important way for the unemployed to gain the skills they need to find employment. Governments should provide job training programs that are tailored to the needs of the unemployed. These programs should provide the necessary skills and knowledge to help the unemployed find jobs that match their skills and interests. Job placement services should also be provided to help the unemployed find suitable employment.
 
 Housing assistance is also an important way for the homeless to find shelter and stability. Governments should provide housing assistance to those who are homeless. This could include providing temporary housing, helping to find permanent housing, and providing financial assistance for rent and utilities. This assistance would help the homeless find stability and a place to call home.
 
 In addition to providing job training and housing assistance, governments should also provide social services to the unemployed and homeless. These services could include mental health services, substance abuse counseling, and financial assistance. These services would help the unemployed and homeless to become more self-sufficient and better able to find and maintain employment.
 
 Overall, governments should be responsible for helping the unemployed and homeless. Job training, housing assistance, and social services are all important ways for governments to provide support to those in need. By providing these services, governments can help the unemployed and homeless to become more self-sufficient and find stability.";"Every nation has a responsibility to ensure that its citizens are taken care of. Governments should have programs in place to help the unemployed and the homeless, as these are the most vulnerable members of society. Unemployment and homelessness can have devastating consequences on individuals, families, and communities. Without assistance, these individuals can become trapped in a cycle of poverty and struggle to become self-sufficient. 
 
 The government should provide resources to help the unemployed and homeless find sustainable employment and housing. This could include job training and placement programs, career counseling, and financial assistance for education and childcare. Employment opportunities should be made available, such as roles in the public or private sector, or small business loans for those hoping to start their own business. Access to affordable housing should also be provided as part of the support system.
 
 In addition to providing services and resources, governments should also address the root causes of unemployment and homelessness. This means tackling larger issues such as poverty, mental health, and inequality. Governments should strive to create a society in which everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed. For example, they could develop initiatives to raise the minimum wage, offer tax breaks to businesses that hire locally, or provide incentives to employers who offer workers better wages and benefits. 
 
 Ultimately, helping the unemployed and homeless is not only the right thing to do, but also an investment in the future of the nation. By supporting these individuals, governments can create a workforce with increased productivity and more money to reinvest in the economy. Additionally, providing these services can help to reduce social ills, such as crime and substance abuse, which are often linked to poverty and homelessness.
 
 In conclusion, in order to create a better life for everyone in a nation, governments should be responsible for helping the unemployed and homeless. Through the provision of services and resources, and by tackling the root causes of poverty and inequality, governments can ensure that these vulnerable members of society are given an opportunity to lead successful, productive lives.";69;1568;1901;2285;2093.0
45;essay46.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/true-function-university-essay-25755/;True Function of A University;"Universities have quickly become the places to go when people seek to further develop their expertise. Whether this really suits the needs of their potential employers is highly unlikely as universities nowadays have evolved as a domain of experts: where more and more is known about less and less. Nevertheless, among the vast range of choices offered there are often some training courses that have direct implications on job-seeking and other aspects in everyday life. However, although I respect the universities' aim of providing such courses to develop skills required for work and support their cause, I do not believe it is the main or best function of a university.
 A university, in common sense, is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge. What is meant by this is that students are the ones universities should really cater for, not the employers, as students are the ones here to seek knowledge. High school graduates choose to further educate themselves in universities because of all different reasons: a degree that's more widely accepted, gain knowledge and insight into an industry, or simply deepen their research interests in a certain field.
 On the other hand, universities and be regarded as institutions where abundant educational resources gather. It is, therefore, not necessary for a certain course or type of training to be offered to the students by a university, but instead, these must be made available when needed. So the truth lies somewhere closer to the fact that a university should provide access to information, rather than offer selected courses that are suitable for employers' taste.
 In conclusion, the main function of a university remains as the provision of knowledge and access to resources. It would be helpful, however, if certain courses concerning workplace skills can also be made available to students to help shape their futures.
";"The true function of a university is to provide students with the opportunity to gain knowledge, develop skills, and become well-rounded individuals. A university provides an environment that encourages learning, exploration, and growth. Through a variety of courses, activities, and experiences, students are able to gain a deeper understanding of the world around them and develop the skills necessary to become successful in their chosen field.
 
 At a university, students are exposed to a wide range of ideas and perspectives. This allows them to explore different topics and gain a better understanding of the world. Through courses, lectures, and discussions, students are able to gain a greater appreciation for different cultures, beliefs, and values. This helps to broaden their horizons and encourages them to think critically about the world around them.
 
 In addition to providing students with knowledge, a university also provides them with the opportunity to develop skills. Through internships, research projects, and other activities, students are able to gain practical experience in their chosen field. This helps to prepare them for the real world and gives them the confidence to pursue their goals.
 
 Finally, a university provides students with the opportunity to become well-rounded individuals. Through clubs, organizations, and other activities, students are able to develop their social skills, build relationships, and become more confident in their abilities. This helps to prepare them for the future and gives them the tools they need to succeed in life.
 
 In conclusion, the true function of a university is to provide students with the opportunity to gain knowledge, develop skills, and become well-rounded individuals. Through a variety of courses, activities, and experiences, students are able to gain a deeper understanding of the world around them and develop the skills necessary to become successful in their chosen field. A university provides an environment that encourages learning, exploration, and growth, and is essential for helping students prepare for the future.";"The primary and true function of a university is to not only to educate and prepare students for the future, but to help foster the development of informed and engaged citizens. It is a place of knowledge, learning and exploration that, when done right, can lead to a more informed population, better equipped to make decisions about the future of their communities and the world. 
 
 At its core, a university provides both formal and informal educational experiences. Students become knowledgeable in their chosen fields, whether that be a specific academic subject, such as engineering or accounting, or a more expansive area, such as the arts or humanities. This is what universities are best known for, and its also the type of education that is most commonly sought after. It is an essential component of a successful university, providing students with the skills, knowledge, and credentials to become successful in their chosen field. 
 
 But a universitys function goes beyond merely educating students. It also serves to help develop informed citizens who are able to think critically and make informed decisions. Universities can provide a space for discussion, debate and discourse on various topics, both in and out of the classroom. This kind of environment directly prepares students for the real world, as they are challenged to weigh various perspectives and consider various arguments on a particular topic or issue. This kind of mindful engagement and deliberative thinking is needed in order for citizens to truly engage in their communities and our world. 
 
 Universities also serve to promote the development of well-rounded individuals. Through a range of extracurricular activities, from clubs and organizations to sports teams, students are able to develop a range of skills and competencies outside of the classroom. This provides students with an opportunity to explore a variety of interests, strive for excellence and develop valuable leadership skills. 
 
 In short, the true function of a university is to prepare students for life beyond the university walls. By providing a well-rounded education that focuses on both knowledge acquisition and the development of citizens, a university is able to ensure that its graduates are ready to become successful, informed citizens of the world.";29;1900;2116;2320;2218.0
46;essay47.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/essay-zoos-should-built-protect-rural-animals-agree-24423/;zoos should be built to protect rural animals;"Preserving wild animals in zoos is an issue which frequently generates a great deal of heated debate, with supporters maintaining that wild life would be taken good care from professionals, while opponents claim that the animals are deprived of freedom as a result of staying in zoos. From my perspective, animals should live in natural habitats instead of zoos.
 To begin with, it is the right of wild species to live in a environment away from human beings. Given the fact that human beings are responsible for the heavy pollution and severe damage to the natural habitats of many wild animals, it is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in. Apparently, the limited space and the artificial trees and lakes can not fully compensate the animals for their loss. Moreover, if rural animals are captured in the zoo for a long period, it would have negative influences on both the physical and psychological status of the creatures. As a result, the wild species would suffer from isolation and depression. It seems that zoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives.
 Nevertheless, supporters would argue that zoos, which are equipped with modern facilities and professionals, would provide better care for the animals inside. They further point out that the endangered species preserved in zoos would never die of illegal hunting. However, I would contend that the strict laws prohibiting poaching would provide a shelter for various kinds of animals in natural habitat. It seems that the growing number of natural habitat would be the ultimate solution of saving wild animals worldwide.
 By way of conclusion, it is my belief that wild animals should be set free from zoos not only because they have the right to enjoy freedom but they also escape from isolation and depression.
";"Zoos have been around for centuries and have been used to protect and conserve animals, both in the wild and in captivity. In recent years, zoos have become increasingly popular as a way to protect rural animals from the dangers of the wild. Zoos provide a safe and secure environment for animals, and can be used to educate people about the importance of conservation and animal welfare.
 
 The most important reason why zoos should be built to protect rural animals is that they provide a safe and secure environment for animals. Zoos are designed to provide a habitat that is similar to the animals natural environment, and they are equipped with the necessary facilities to ensure the health and safety of the animals. Zoos also provide a place for animals to breed and reproduce, which helps to maintain the population of endangered species. Additionally, zoos provide a place for animals to socialize and interact with each other, which helps to keep them healthy and happy.
 
 Another important reason why zoos should be built to protect rural animals is that they can be used to educate people about the importance of conservation and animal welfare. Zoos provide an opportunity for people to learn about the different species of animals, their habitats, and the threats they face in the wild. By visiting a zoo, people can gain a better understanding of the importance of conservation and animal welfare, and can be encouraged to take action to protect the environment.
 
 Finally, zoos can be used to raise awareness about the plight of rural animals. By visiting a zoo, people can learn about the threats that rural animals face, such as habitat destruction, poaching, and climate change. This can help to raise awareness about the need to protect rural animals and their habitats, and can encourage people to take action to protect them.
 
 In conclusion, zoos should be built to protect rural animals. Zoos provide a safe and secure environment for animals, and can be used to educate people about the importance of conservation and animal welfare. Additionally, zoos can be used to raise awareness about the plight of rural animals, and can encourage people to take action to protect them. For these reasons, zoos should be built to protect rural animals.";"Zoos are wonderful places that give us a chance to learn about the amazing world of animals. They bring us close to species we would never be able to see in the wild, and they protect vulnerable and endangered species. But recently, more and more people have begun to question the necessity of zoos. Should we build them to protect rural animals as well?
 
 The need for zoos to protect rural animals is great. In some regions, wild animal populations have suffered drastically due to habitat loss, hunting, and other human activities. This means that these creatures are at great risk of losing their homes and their lives. With zoos, we can create protected habitats for them, allowing them to live stress-free and safe from human forces. Furthermore, these zoos provide tremendous educational opportunities for people. They can learn about the plight of rural animals and raise awareness to keep them safe.
 
 However, it is important to recognize that zoos also present some serious disadvantages. Creating and maintaining zoos can be incredibly costly, and these expenses are often shouldered by taxpayers. Furthermore, there is the potential for animal mistreatment. When animals are kept in enclosures, there is a risk that they could experience psychological stress or be subject to neglect. Additionally, some argue that keeping animals in captivity detracts from their natural habitat, and that the money used to fund the zoo could be put toward conservation instead.
 
 For all these reasons, it is important to carefully consider the pros and cons of zoos before we build them to protect rural animals. However, when done responsibly, zoos can be a powerful tool for conservation and education. They provide a safe haven for vulnerable creatures, and they give us the chance to learn more about them. In the end, it is up to us to decide how we want to protect rural animals and ensure their survival in the wild.";45;1861;2269;1925;2097.0
47;essay48.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/essay-distance-learning-vs-attending-school-person-23759/;distance-learning vs. attending school in person;"A matter of considerable controversy at present is the issue of whether distance-learning should be promoted as much as possible, or rather attending lectures in person should be allowed to take a predominant place in universities because this way of learning is superior than online degrees. From my perspective, online-teaching should be widely used among colleges and universities in terms of convenience and optimizing cost for educational institutions.
 To begin with, distance-learning brings significant convenience for students in every corner of the world. In earlier times, students who were tired of commuting had to attend schools nearby, regardless of any differences in teaching facilities, teacher's qualifications or the school reputation. Now, however, students are able to apply for online-courses provided by top-of-the-range universities and colleges worldwide. Furthermore, the presence of video conferencing allows a teacher to teach a greater number of students. Consequently, educational institutions are able to optimize costs by increasing teacher-student ratios. Thanks to the economical online-teaching, universities and colleges are able to offer grants for students who have outstanding academic achievements but are unable to attend schools because of financial constrains.
 Nevertheless, opponents of online-degrees would argue that attending lectures in person provides students an opportunity to communicate with teachers and other classmates. They further point out that traditional teaching approaches involving discussion and cooperation among students play a significant role in campus life. It is the real interactions and communications in class make education much more attractive.
 By way of conclusion, it is my belief that distance-learning will become increasingly important in the future as the pace of life increases. However, discussions and interactions should be held via video conferencing frequently so that the joy of learning would not be diminished.
";"Distance-learning vs. Attending School in Person
 
 In todays world, technology has made it possible for students to learn from anywhere in the world. Distance-learning has become increasingly popular, offering students the opportunity to learn from the comfort of their own home. However, there are still many benefits to attending school in person. This essay will explore the pros and cons of distance-learning and attending school in person, and discuss which option is best for students.
 
 Distance-learning has many advantages. It is often more convenient and flexible than attending school in person. Students can work at their own pace and have more control over their learning environment. Distance-learning also allows students to access a wider range of courses and resources than they would have access to in a traditional classroom setting. Additionally, distance-learning can be more cost-effective than attending school in person, as students do not have to pay for transportation or other associated costs.
 
 However, there are also some drawbacks to distance-learning. It can be difficult for students to stay motivated and engaged when learning from home. Additionally, students may not have access to the same level of support and guidance that they would receive in a traditional classroom setting. Furthermore, distance-learning can be isolating, as students may not have the opportunity to interact with their peers and build relationships with their teachers.
 
 Attending school in person also has its advantages. Students have the opportunity to interact with their peers and build relationships with their teachers. Additionally, students can receive immediate feedback and support from their teachers, which can help them stay motivated and engaged in their studies. Furthermore, attending school in person allows students to take part in extracurricular activities, such as sports and clubs, which can help them develop important skills and build relationships with their peers.
 
 However, there are also some drawbacks to attending school in person. It can be expensive, as students have to pay for transportation and other associated costs. Additionally, attending school in person can be time-consuming, as students have to factor in travel time and other commitments. Furthermore, students may not have access to the same range of courses and resources that they would have access to through distance-learning.
 
 Overall, both distance-learning and attending school in person have their advantages and disadvantages. The best option for students will depend on their individual needs and circumstances. For some students, distance-learning may be the best option, as it can be more convenient and cost-effective. For other students, attending school in person may be the best option, as it can provide them with the opportunity to interact with their peers and build relationships with their teachers.";"Distance-learning versus attending school in person is a debate that continues to circulate the education world. While both offer unique benefits, both also come with unique drawbacks. Let's take a closer look at the pros and cons of distance-learning versus attending school in person.
 
 Distance-learning has the benefit of allowing students to work on their own time with no pressure from instructors or peers. This can be extremely beneficial for those who have difficulty in a traditional classroom setting. Another advantage of distance-learning is that it can be more cost effective since there are fewer overhead costs associated with it. On the downside, this type of learning can be more challenging since it requires self-discipline and commitment to stay on top of assignments. It can also be difficult to stay connected with classmates, which can be an important part of learning.
 
 Attending school in person has the benefits of being able to interact with instructors and peers. This type of learning is conducive to more social interaction and can be helpful in developing relationships. Additionally, there is often more of a focus on the content, with instructors providing direct instruction. On the downside, this type of learning can be more expensive, as there are costs associated with the physical space and instruction. There is also less flexibility with in-person learning and it can be difficult for those with transportation or scheduling challenges.
 
 Both distance-learning and attending school in person have their pros and cons, so it is important to consider which approach best suits the individual's needs. Ultimately, it comes down to what works best for each person and what they are most comfortable with. Both can have a major role to play in education, and having the option to choose between the two can be beneficial for many students.";48;2005;2937;1881;2409.0
48;essay49.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/modern-communication-technologies-benefit-all-people-essay-23506/;Do modern communication technologies benefit all people;"Modern communication technologies such as mobile phones, e-mails and internet chat programs like the MSN Messenger have brought significant changes to our lives in recent years. Yet, there remains some disagreement as to whether the overall effect of this innovation has been positive or negative. Although there are valid arguments to the contrary, it is my belief that the majority of people in the globe have benefited greatly from these powerful and effective means of modern communication.
 To begin with, mobile phones and other tools of modern communication facilitate not only contact with friends and relatives in faraway places but also global business. With the click of a button, the vast amount of information can be transmitted from America to China in just a few seconds. Furthermore, it is generally felt that the access to these tools of communication is available in every corner of the world. With a mobile phone or a laptop, a person can talk or send messages online at a bus stop, in a corner shop or anywhere they could imagine. Therefore, it seems that these new forms of communication do bring a great deal of convenience to humankind.
 Nevertheless, opponents of modern communications claim that only the more privileged are able to enjoy the benefits. They further point out that the wide spread use of these efficient and effective ways of communication costs a considerable amount of money. Anyone who aims to use these innovations have to not only pay for the appliances such as a mobile phone or a computer but also cover up costs for communication services. Consequently, people who live in poverty are less likely to be benefited from modern communication technologies.
 By way of conclusion, I believe that modern communication technologies will benefit more people in the future as the pace of life increases; however, the have-nots cannot be ignored simply because they couldn't afford it.
";"In the modern world, communication technologies have become an integral part of our lives. From smartphones to social media, these technologies have revolutionized the way we interact with each other. But do these technologies benefit all people?
 
 The answer is yes and no. On one hand, modern communication technologies have made it easier than ever for people to stay connected. We can now communicate with people from all over the world in an instant. We can also access a wealth of information and resources online, which can be invaluable for those who are looking to learn or stay informed.
 
 On the other hand, these technologies can also have a negative impact on people. For example, the prevalence of social media has been linked to increased levels of anxiety and depression, as people are constantly comparing themselves to others online. Additionally, the spread of misinformation and fake news can be damaging to peoples understanding of the world.
 
 Overall, modern communication technologies can be beneficial for some people, but they can also be detrimental for others. It is important to be aware of the potential risks and to use these technologies responsibly.";"In the contemporary world, modern communication technologies have become an integral part of our lives and are being used for countless tasks, from simplicity to complexity. People all around the world are using these technologies, also known as the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), to better their lives and stay connected with friends, family, and strangers alike. 
 
 It is true that modern communication technologies have provided many advantages, but these advantages are not necessarily enjoyed by all people. For example, one of the main benefits derived from modern communication technologies is that they enable people to stay connected, no matter the distance. This is especially beneficial for those working abroad, or those separated from their loved ones. It is much easier and more practical to connect with someone thousands of miles away through the internet rather than conventional modes of communication, such as postal mail or telephone. Unfortunately, those living in areas with limited or no access to the internet due to infrastructure issues, or those without the required financial means, may not be able to experience the advantages brought about by modern communication technologies. 
 
 Another benefit of modern communication technologies is their ability to allow people to access different services and resources, such as online banking or educational opportunities. Various websites and applications offer different services and resources that are often not available to those not connected to the internet or with limited financial means. Without access to modern communication technologies, these resources are often inaccessible to people living in remote areas or in countries with limited internet access. 
 
 In addition, modern communication technologies also allow for the exchange of multimedia content, such as videos and pictures, that can be shared with people all over the world in a matter of seconds. This content can be used to educate and inform people, spark conversations, and even facilitate social interaction. However, those who don't have access to modern communication technologies or can't afford them may miss out on these potential benefits. 
 
 While modern communication technologies offer a number of benefits, the fact remains that not everyone can access or afford the devices, internet access, or services needed to make use of them. While access to ICTs has improved drastically over the last decade, it is still not reaching those in remote rural areas or in developing countries, as well as those with limited financial means. Until these issues are addressed, modern communication technologies will not benefit all people.";55;1925;1185;2709;1947.0
49;essay50.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/essay-should-high-school-make-music-lessons-compulsory-23445/;Should high school make music lessons compulsory;"Most people claim that in high school music must be taught as a main subject, while others say that this is an unnecessary subject and should at least be optional. In this essay I will give my opinion for both sides.
 It is obvious that music has a great power which can positively influence on human being and its psychology. Therefore, many university authorities provide music lessons for their students so that they live and study in a harmony with music. I have an impression that students, who spend a great deal of their time studying different academic subjects should have an opportunity to cope with the stress gained during school time. In this case, music can be a useful and interesting solution. Moreover, if musical activity involves many participants, there will be co-operation and developed team work in the group, which is, of course, beneficial in their future life. In fact, students with a quite poor academic background can show themselves in the music. Consequently, the calm atmosphere in the class might be created.
 By contrast, it is clear that music can have many mentally enhancing effects on students. In our hectic life, however, demand is not for musically orientated students, but for academically developed employees. Hence, I agree with the majority, because music is the art which requires special attitude towards it. Increasingly however, students can not obtain supposed impacts, unless they get interested in it more seriously. Therefore, music and other entertaining subjects should be optional. Nowadays, time is the most valuable thing in life with increased pace. To my mind, students are to develop their professional skills by learning occupation-related subjects, rather than playing on guitar or singing a song.
 In conclusion, I think that in order to be a competitive worker, students must know their field in an advanced level. On the other hand, music can help an individual to shape its character. An integration of music into learning process bound to be successful when it is not compulsory.
";"Music has been an integral part of human life since time immemorial. It has been used to express emotions, to tell stories, to celebrate, and to bring people together. Music has been proven to have a positive effect on mental health, and it can even help improve academic performance. With all these benefits, it makes sense that high school should make music lessons compulsory.
 
 First of all, music lessons can help students develop important skills that will be useful in their future lives. Music lessons can help students develop their creativity, problem-solving skills, and critical thinking. These skills are essential for success in any field, and music lessons can help students hone these skills. Furthermore, music lessons can also help students develop their self-discipline and time management skills, which are also important for success in any field.
 
 Second, music lessons can help students develop their social skills. Music lessons involve working with other students, and this can help students learn how to collaborate and work together. This is an important skill that will be useful in any profession. Furthermore, music lessons can also help students develop their communication skills, which are essential for success in any field.
 
 Finally, music lessons can help students develop their emotional intelligence. Music can be a powerful tool for expressing emotions, and music lessons can help students learn how to express their emotions in a healthy way. This can help students develop their emotional intelligence, which is essential for success in any field.
 
 In conclusion, high school should make music lessons compulsory. Music lessons can help students develop important skills that will be useful in their future lives, such as creativity, problem-solving skills, critical thinking, self-discipline, time management, social skills, communication skills, and emotional intelligence. With all these benefits, it makes sense that high school should make music lessons compulsory.";"Music has long been an important part of life around the world, with its ability to bring people together, stir emotions, and create a common language. It has been used historically as an education aid, helping students learn techniques and reach a higher level of understanding with its elements of melody, harmony, and rhythm. With the potential educational benefits, it would make sense to make music lessons compulsory in high schools.
 
 An obvious benefit of introducing music lessons into all high schools is the increase in musical appreciation and understanding, and therefore, the more likely students will be to want to pursue music. This would create a rise in the number of people engaging in music as a hobby, as well as reducing the stigma of it being a hobby for the wealthy, as it can often be seen today. Also, the amount of people going into the music industry, be it as performers, composers, or teachers, would increase, creating an overall improvement in the industry.
 
 Furthermore, it has been proven that people who take part in musical activities show an increase in IQ, concentration, and a higher level of understanding of other subjects. Music enhances cognitive abilities, and by making music lessons compulsory in all high schools, this would allow for a greater number of students to benefit from this attribute. It has also been said that people who learn music can have an improved sense of order, allowing better organization and communication skills. This could prove invaluable to the job market and the future of the students.
 
 There are, of course, some potential negatives to music lessons being compulsory in high schools. One of these is the cost and the amount of time necessary to introduce music into the curriculum, needing to train teachers, hire new staff, and buy equipment. Also, some students may feel intimidated by the idea of having to learn a musical instrument, and may not enjoy the lessons, so they instead give up and don't put in any effort.
 
 Many studies have shown that music can be very beneficial on an educational level, and so if funding can be made available to support a program, music lessons should be compulsory in high school. It would lead to an increase in the appreciation of music and have a positive impact on the growing industry, as well as helping to improve cognitive abilities. It could also be cost effective, as implementing music lessons into the curriculum may have a longer lasting effect than spending money on purely academic activities.";48;2048;2017;2531;2274.0
50;essay51.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/essay-pros-cons-developments-agriculture-23379/;pros and cons of developments in agriculture;"A matter of considerable controversy at present is the issue of whether developments in agriculture are beneficial to humankind, or rather these developments should be allowed to die out just as many inappropriate innovations have in the past. From my perspective, these developments in agricultures should be preserved for the sake of the benefits of all human beings.
 To begin with, innovations in agriculture such as mechanized farming and the creations of genetic engineering foods may be the only way to feed the vast number of people in every corner of the world. Imagine the tragedies that would ensue if people lived in famine and started to eat people to survive. Therefore, governments around the world have the obligation to fund in technological developments in farming in order to make an enough production of food for its people. Another reason for applied technology in agriculture is the low-priced foods resulted from the widely used of factory farming. Thanks to the lower expenditure in food consuming, low income people now have sufficient money to cover up costs in health and education.
 Nonetheless, opponents of modern technology in agriculture would argue that the proliferation of GE food and factory farming are detrimental to people's health. They further suggest that food which is genetically modified interrupts the natural balance of the ecosystem and would return to haunt us in unexpected ways. In other words, although technological developments in agriculture is beneficial in the short term, its long term negatives are significant.
 In reality, of course, the wide spread use of modern technology in agriculture may be problematic in itself; however, given the seriousness of food insufficiency through out the world, I believe this would be the ultimate goal.
";"The development of agriculture has had a profound impact on the world. It has allowed for the growth of civilizations, the production of food, and the development of technology. However, with the advancements in agriculture come both pros and cons.
 
 The most obvious pro of developments in agriculture is the increased production of food. With the introduction of new technologies, such as genetic engineering, farmers are able to produce more food with less land and resources. This has allowed for a greater variety of food to be available to people all over the world. Additionally, the use of fertilizers and pesticides has allowed for greater yields of crops, which has helped to feed more people.
 
 Another pro of developments in agriculture is the increased efficiency of farming. With the use of modern machinery and technology, farmers are able to work more quickly and efficiently. This has allowed for a greater output of food, as well as a decrease in labor costs. Additionally, the use of technology has allowed for the development of precision agriculture, which allows for more precise application of fertilizers and pesticides, resulting in less waste and a more efficient use of resources.
 
 On the other hand, there are some cons to developments in agriculture. One of the most significant is the environmental impact of agricultural practices. The use of fertilizers and pesticides can lead to soil and water contamination, as well as air pollution. Additionally, the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) has raised concerns about the potential health risks associated with their use.
 
 Finally, the development of agriculture has had an impact on the social and economic structure of many countries. The use of modern technology has allowed for large-scale farming operations, which can lead to the displacement of small-scale farmers. Additionally, the use of technology has allowed for the consolidation of farms, which can lead to a decrease in competition and an increase in the cost of food.
 
 In conclusion, the development of agriculture has had both positive and negative impacts. On the one hand, it has allowed for increased production of food, increased efficiency of farming, and the development of precision agriculture. On the other hand, it has had an environmental impact, as well as a social and economic impact. Ultimately, it is up to individuals and governments to weigh the pros and cons of developments in agriculture and decide how to best use them.";"Since the development of agriculture, many people around the world have been able to feed and sustain themselves. From increasing crop yields to improving animal husbandry, the advances in agriculture have immense potential to benefit society. However, there are also potential drawbacks of these developments, as reliance on ever-increasing amounts of modern agricultural practices and technology can come with a variety of environmental, economic, and social costs.
 
 The most obvious benefit of agricultural development is increasing yields. Developments such as genetically modified crops, hybrid seeds, and crop rotation allow farmers to grow more with less input of land and resources. This is particularly important in the case of developing countries, where limited land makes it difficult to feed a large population. Increased yield also contributes to food security and better nutrition by reducing the cost of food, making it more readily available to poorer communities.
 
 In addition to increasing yields, developments in agriculture can also create jobs. Many new technologies and farming practices require more labor, making it possible to employ more people in the agricultural sector. This in turn can provide economic stability, especially in rural areas where jobs are often scarce.
 
 On the other hand, agricultural developments can have some negative impacts. For instance, increased reliance on modern technology and industrial practices can lead to environmental costs. Pesticides and fertilizers have been linked to the loss of biodiversity, soil degradation, and water pollution. Similarly, monoculture farming and intensive livestock farming can lead to soil erosion, water depletion, and the spread of disease.
 
 In addition, the development of agricultural technology often leads to an increased centralization of the industry. This means that large corporations are better able to control the food supply, leading to reduced competition and higher prices. This can have a disproportionate impact on small farmers and those in developing countries, who often cannot afford to acquire the latest technology or compete with larger companies.
 
 In conclusion, the developments in agriculture come with both benefits and drawbacks. On one hand, they can improve yields and create jobs, leading to improved nutrition and economic stability. On the other hand, they can have negative impacts on the environment and cause an increase in market concentration, leading to higher prices and reduced competition. It is important to weigh the pros and cons of any development in agriculture to ensure that its benefits outweigh its costs.";44;1800;2506;2659;2582.5
51;essay52.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/the-advantages-disadvantages-prevalent-english-23262/;advantages and disadvantages of the prevalent of English;"With the development of globalization, English became the dominated language in national trade, conference and many important events. This phenomenon has aroused a heated discussion in public.
 Some people claim that the prevalent of English brings a great number of benefits for people. First of all, it promotes the communication and interaction between different countries more conveniently and clearly. In the ancient time, the different languages and geography set barriers for people to exchange their goods and ideas. Fortunately, the innovation of plane and train solved the geographical barriers. If we can popularize the use of English, the language hinder will disappear as well. In addition, English is a beautiful language, which is more systematical and extensive than many other languages. Learning English can foster people's sentiment and nourish their literature and art.
 However, the opponents believe that the dominated status of English has destroyed culture diversity and many less-used languages become extinct. Even English is a sophisticated language; it does not express every detail of life especially in Asia countries, which have totally different linguistic system. It is undeniable that language contains many aspects of people's daily life, which is influenced by culture, environment as well as religious. Obviously, these languages have special significance for people who belong to them and using English to replace them is crudity.
 Personally, English as an elegant language should be advocated in many fields to expand the global trade and communications. But, we still need preserve other languages for sake of keeping the linguistic and cultural diversity.
";"The prevalence of English as a global language has both advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, English has become the lingua franca of the world, allowing people from different countries to communicate with each other more easily. This has helped to bridge cultural divides and create a more unified global community. Additionally, English has become the language of business, science, and technology, allowing people to access information and resources more easily.
 
 On the other hand, the prevalence of English has had some negative effects. For example, it has caused the decline of many other languages, as people are increasingly speaking English instead of their native language. This can lead to a loss of cultural identity and a lack of appreciation for the diversity of languages around the world. Additionally, English is often seen as a language of privilege, as those who are able to speak it fluently are often seen as more educated and successful. This can lead to feelings of exclusion and inequality among those who do not speak English.
 
 Overall, the prevalence of English has both advantages and disadvantages. While it has helped to create a more unified global community, it has also caused the decline of many other languages and can lead to feelings of exclusion and inequality. It is important to recognize both the positive and negative effects of English in order to ensure that all languages are respected and appreciated.";"English is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, and its dominance can be seen in many aspects of everyday life. While the widespread use of English has many advantages, it also brings disadvantages along with it.
 
 One of the biggest advantages of the prevalence of English is the increased communication that is made possible by its widespread use. By speaking a common language, individuals are able to communicate more easily with each other, resulting in greater understanding between people, businesses and countries. Additionally, people who are fluent in English can communicate and access information shared by people who are not fluent in their native language. This means that people from all over the world are able to form connections, even if they do not share the same native language.
 
 Another advantage of English being so widely spoken is the improved access to education it provides. English is often the language of instruction in schools and universities, meaning that anyone who speaks it has the opportunity to access educational materials and opportunities. Furthermore, English is often a requirement for many jobs, and having knowledge of it can be an advantage in the job market and is often a prerequisite for higher-level positions.
 
 On the other hand, the widespread use of English also has some disadvantages. For one, the prevalence of English can create a disadvantage for those who do not speak it. This could lead to a loss of cultural identity, as people may begin to use English instead of their native language and begin to forget their traditional customs. Additionally, the English language could be eliminating important aspects of the cultures of people who do not speak it, as well as their native languages, which could lead to a decrease in cultural diversity.
 
 Finally, the prevalence of English can have a negative impact on the environment. For example, learning English often requires a lot of resources, such as textbooks, dictionaries, and other materials, resulting in an environmental impact that could be avoided if English was not so widely spoken.
 
 In conclusion, the prevalence of English can have both advantages and disadvantages. While it can make communication and education easier, it can also lead to a loss of cultural diversity and an environmental impact. Ultimately, the decision to learn and use English should depend on the individual and how it will impact their lives.";56;1698;1460;2464;1962.0
52;essay53.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/humans-should-able-use-animals-own-benefit-27603/;humans should be able to use animals for their own benefit?;"Man has dominated all his fellow beings on earth because of his superior brain. He has domesticated a large number of animals and birds and makes use of them to make life easier and convenient for himself. Many people encourage the use of animals for their personal needs, while others are concerned that animals should not be misused. This essay will discuss some arguments for and against animal domestication.
 Human being has driven many animals for their personal use such as, cows and other milch animals for yielding milk from them. Likewise, other animals such as, horses, cattles and donkeys for farming, agriculture and as a mode of transportation. Many people keep pets like dogs and cats, trained them as service dogs and snuffing dogs which are very helpful to police force and even to some blind peoples. They are kept for security purposes in houses.
 On the other hand, many farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their limits. For instance, cows are often injected by Oxytocin, a hormone which is used to forcibly increase lactation. This in turn, causes lots of discomfort and pain to the cattle. Furthermore, thousand of animals undergo painful suffering or death as a result of scientific research of drugs and various products. Another example of this is cage farming which is against animal rights. Many other practices like, equestrian sport where horses run miles and miles and beaten up by jockeys to make them run more faster. And above all pleasure hunting of defenseless animals.
 From my prospective, human being should behave as a guardian to animals rather than as their lord or masters. Animal rights are meant to set limits on human behavior and manipulation of them should be punished as a serious crime.
";"Humans have been using animals for their own benefit since the dawn of civilization. From providing food and clothing to providing transportation, animals have been integral to human progress. In recent years, however, the use of animals for human benefit has come under increased scrutiny, with some arguing that it is unethical and should be stopped. While it is true that animals should be treated with respect and care, there are many benefits to using animals for human benefit that should be considered.
 
 First, animals can provide humans with food, clothing, and other resources. For example, cows provide milk, chickens provide eggs, and sheep provide wool. These resources are essential for human survival and can be used to improve the quality of life for many people. Additionally, animals can be used for transportation, such as horses and camels, which can help people travel long distances.
 
 Second, animals can be used for medical research. While it is true that animal testing can be cruel and inhumane, it is also true that it can lead to important medical breakthroughs. For example, animal testing has been used to develop treatments for diseases such as cancer and HIV/AIDS. Additionally, animal testing can be used to develop new drugs and treatments that can help improve the quality of life for many people.
 
 Finally, animals can be used for entertainment. From circuses to zoos, animals have been used to provide entertainment for people for centuries. While it is true that some forms of animal entertainment can be cruel and inhumane, there are also forms of animal entertainment that are humane and provide educational opportunities for people.
 
 In conclusion, while it is true that animals should be treated with respect and care, there are many benefits to using animals for human benefit that should be considered. From providing food and clothing to providing transportation and medical research, animals can be used to improve the quality of life for many people. Additionally, animals can be used for entertainment, providing educational opportunities for people. For these reasons, humans should be able to use animals for their own benefit.";"The use of animals by humans has been a common occurrence for centuries, and for many people, this makes perfect sense. After all, animals have been domesticated for many purposes and have been used for farming, transportation, and even companionship. However, the question of whether humans should be allowed to use animals for their own benefit has been a long-debated topic. There are some valid arguments that can be made to both sides, and this essay will explore some of these points. 
 
 On one side of the argument, it is argued that animals should be treated with respect and not used solely for the benefit of humans. Animals have feelings and should not be treated any less than humans, so it can be argued that using them as a means to our own ends is unethical. There are also arguments to be made that this type of treatment of animals is not beneficial for the animals mental or physical well-being. The argument can also be made that using animals in this way does not benefit the animals in the long run, and that it can lead to a type of physical and mental suffering that could have been avoided.
 
 On the other side of the argument, it can be argued that using animals for human benefit is beneficial for both parties. It is argued that using animals for certain tasks can be beneficial for the animals in the long run, such as providing food, providing companionship, or providing transportation. It is also argued that this type of use can provide the humans with the necessary resources to maintain a healthy lifestyle, and in many cases, it can be seen as a form of symbiotic relationship between the two species. 
 
 Ultimately, the decision whether or not to allow humans to use animals for their own benefit should be made on a case-by-case basis. If the use of the animals is understood to be beneficial for both parties, and if the animals are treated with respect and care, then it can be argued that the use of animals for human benefit is acceptable. However, if the use is seen to be harmful to the animals or if they are treated as objects, then it can be argued that the use of animals should not be allowed.";59;1742;2183;2144;2163.5
53;essay54.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/museums-art-galleries-disappear-soon-27515/;museums and art galleries will disappear soon?;"It is quite common that more and more people can watch exhibitions through television or internet at home due to modern technology; therefore, some people think museums and art galleries will disappear soon. Although modern technology make it possible, I still believe some museums and art galleries will not disappear.
 On the one hand, technology indeed simplifies people's life all the time. Obviously, people who watch exhibitions on TV or internet at home, save the time and money on the road, which is increasingly significant particularly to people in modern society. However, in accordance with recent research, experts suggest the lifestyle of individuals in modern society is unhealthy because they lack of physical exercise and face-to-face communication.
 On the other hand, the importance of museums and art galleries is plain in terms of education and culture. First of all, authentic exhibits cannot be completely displayed only by images and videos. It is like travelling to a place is much better than viewing the landscape of that place on TV or photos, so the best method to learn one thing is to experience it. Furthermore, museums and art galleries preserve some culture heritages; therefore, these buildings will not disappear unless people abandon their culture.
 In conclusion, I admit that modern technology has provided a more convenient and comfortable manner for people to watch exhibitions, but museums and art galleries are necessary to be preserved for its importance of education and culture.
";"Museums and art galleries have been a part of human culture for centuries, providing a place for people to explore and appreciate art, history, and culture. However, in recent years, there has been a growing concern that these institutions may soon disappear. This essay will discuss the reasons why museums and art galleries may soon become a thing of the past, and what can be done to ensure their survival.
 
 The first reason why museums and art galleries may soon disappear is due to the changing nature of technology. With the rise of digital media, people are increasingly turning to the internet for their entertainment and education. This means that museums and art galleries are no longer the only source of information and entertainment, and people are less likely to visit them. Furthermore, the cost of maintaining a museum or art gallery is becoming increasingly prohibitive, as they require a large amount of money to keep up with the latest technology and to keep their collections up to date.
 
 The second reason why museums and art galleries may soon disappear is due to the changing nature of society. As society becomes more diverse and globalized, people are less likely to visit museums and art galleries that focus on a single culture or region. Furthermore, as people become more focused on their own lives and interests, they are less likely to take the time to visit museums and art galleries.
 
 Finally, the third reason why museums and art galleries may soon disappear is due to the changing nature of the economy. As the economy becomes more globalized, it is becoming increasingly difficult for museums and art galleries to stay afloat financially. This is due to the fact that they are often dependent on donations and grants, which are becoming increasingly scarce.
 
 In order to ensure the survival of museums and art galleries, it is important for governments and other organizations to provide financial support. This could include providing grants or subsidies to museums and art galleries, or providing tax incentives for those who donate to them. Additionally, it is important for museums and art galleries to embrace new technologies and to find ways to use them to reach out to new audiences. Finally, it is important for museums and art galleries to focus on providing unique and interesting experiences that will draw people in and keep them coming back.
 
 In conclusion, museums and art galleries are an important part of our culture, and it is important that we do what we can to ensure their survival. While it is true that they may soon disappear due to the changing nature of technology, society, and the economy, there are steps that can be taken to ensure their survival. By providing financial support, embracing new technologies, and providing unique and interesting experiences, museums and art galleries can remain a part of our culture for years to come.";"Museums and art galleries have been an integral part of the history and culture of civilization. From the earliest days of ancient Egypt to the present day, these institutions have served as a repository of the cultural memory of humanity, showcasing the creativity and diversity of artists and cultures all around the world. Unfortunately, in recent years, there has been an increasing trend of museums and art galleries beginning to close their doors. This is due to a variety of factors, such as financial difficulties, lack of funding, declining attendance, and competition with other forms of entertainment.
 
 The closure of these institutions can have far-reaching consequences for the cultural landscape of a city or region. Without these institutions, the local population may be denied the opportunity to explore, experience, and learn from the works of art on display. Communities may also be deprived of the educational opportunities, public programming, and economic boost that these institutions often provide.
 
 The closure of museums and art galleries is also a symptom of a broader, more systemic problem. It's indicative of the shrinking support for cultural institutions, the overall lack of resources dedicated to sustaining these places, and the fluctuating social tastes of the public. This trend may seem unavoidable in a society that constantly seeks and desires novelty and instant gratification.
 
 However, there are steps that can be taken to ensure that museums and art galleries remain a part of our cultural fabric. Governments should prioritize public funding and financial support for these institutions as part of cultural policy. Corporations can also increase their sponsorship and donations of funds and resources. Finally, individuals motivated by the preservation of cultural heritage may also donate their time, expertise, and resources to these institutions.
 
 In conclusion, the closure of museums and art galleries is a stark reminder of the fragility of our cultural heritage and the importance of recognizing and preserving it. With the implementation of public initiatives and increased investment from the public and private domains, it is possible to keep these institutions alive and accessible to the public.";46;1525;2912;2260;2586.0
54;essay55.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/should-teenagers-learn-all-school-subjects-focus-one-subject-27187/;should teenagers learn all school subjects/focus on one subject;"Presently, it is commonly accepted that students have to learn over eight subjects in school. Public retain differing views on whether to teach students all subjects or just focus on one subject. Some parents are satisfied with the full class schedule of their children. While, others claim that studying only one subject is more effective. Before rendering my own opinion, I will explore sides of this topic.
 The benefits of teaching students different units are easily recognized. In the first place, with some basic knowledge of diverse fields, students have more options in choosing specialized areas or jobs in the future. Teenagers are still too young and immature to decide what they are going to dedicate. In students' point of view, the combination of difficult and easy subjects balances their schoolwork stress and fosters their enthusiasm on classes. However, still many teenagers cannot enjoy the variation of the curriculum, instead, they feel more stressful with so much homework and exams to be done. Besides, most students regard the extra knowledge useless and impractical for their future jobs.
 Those who advocate focusing on one subject believe that this education model can cultivate more talents who specialized in different areas and increase studying effectiveness. This is probably because students can devote more time and efforts in one subject and reduce pressure from other subjects. However, the drawbacks of this teaching method cannot be neglected. Most importantly, under such target-oriented education environment, teenagers may be hard to regret their original choice and change their specialized field in their further study. Moreover, the dullness of course may deeply influence their passion on study.
 It is undeniable that concentrating on one subject can reduce students' pressure and foster the effectiveness in training talents, while its shortfalls are so vital to students' future. Therefore, I do support the view of learning all school subjects.
";"In todays world, teenagers are faced with a variety of choices when it comes to their education. One of the most important decisions they must make is whether to focus on one subject or to learn all school subjects. While there are benefits to both approaches, there are also drawbacks. Ultimately, the decision should be based on the individual students interests, goals, and abilities.
 
 The primary benefit of learning all school subjects is that it provides students with a well-rounded education. By studying a variety of topics, students gain a broad understanding of the world around them. This can be especially beneficial for those who are considering pursuing a college degree or a career in a particular field. Additionally, learning all school subjects can help students develop critical thinking skills, as they are exposed to different perspectives and ideas.
 
 On the other hand, focusing on one subject can also be beneficial. By honing in on one particular area of study, students can gain a deeper understanding of the subject. This can be especially helpful for those who are considering a career in a specific field. Additionally, focusing on one subject can help students develop a greater sense of mastery and confidence in their abilities.
 
 Ultimately, the decision of whether to focus on one subject or to learn all school subjects should be based on the individual students interests, goals, and abilities. For some students, a well-rounded education is the best approach. For others, focusing on one subject may be the best choice. It is important for students to consider their own interests and goals when making this decision.";"When it comes to learning in school, there is no right or wrong answer to whether teenagers should learn all school subjects or focus on one subject. Ultimately, it is up to individual students to decide which approach works best for them in order to achieve their goals. However, there are a number of factors to consider when looking at both options, and this essay will provide an overview of the pros and cons associated with each. 
 
 Firstly, it is important to consider the advantages of learning all school subjects. Learning a variety of different topics will provide teenagers with a comprehensive education and a wide array of skills that can be applied to various areas of their lives. For instance, studying a variety of topics can help teenagers understand how different branches of knowledge intersect and gain a deeper understanding of a range of topics. Furthermore, choosing to learn all school subjects can give teenagers the opportunity to discover new interests and explore potential future career paths. 
 
 On the other hand, focusing on one subject has its own advantages. For those who are passionate and determined to pursue a specific career path, choosing to focus on one subject can provide them with the opportunity to gain a deeper knowledge in their chosen field and establish a strong foundation that can support their future ambitions. Additionally, studying one subject can be more conducive to understanding complex concepts and acquiring advanced skills that are specific and applicable to that certain discipline. 
 
 When making a decision between learning all school subjects or focusing on one subject, teenagers should take into consideration the goals they wish to achieve in the future. For those aiming to gain a good understanding of various areas, a comprehensive curriculum can be beneficial. However, for those with aspirations to pursue a specific career, focusing on one subject can be a more suitable option. 
 
 In conclusion, it is important for teenagers to consider their goals, needs and interests when deciding whether to learn all school subjects or to focus on one subject. Both options have their own advantages, but it is ultimately up to each individual student to decide which approach works best for them.";63;1995;1659;2270;1964.5
55;essay56.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/influence-english-advantages-outweigh-disadvantages-26911/;Influence of English - advantages outweigh the disadvantages;"In the present age, it is a matter of fact that increasing minority languages have diminished from the world due to the proliferation of English. Some people claim it's a reasonable loss in globalization while others argue the demerits exceed the merits. Personally, I agree with the former opinion.
 No one can deny the huge benefits of the trend that English is being accepted universally. To begin with, communication between countries and cultures become convenient. In my country, English is a required course from elementary school. Thus, studying abroad is easy and becomes hot among youngsters. For them, language obstacle is no longer a problem, which results in mutual understanding and trust between their mother land and the host country. This, in turn, enhances relationship and promotes international business. Furthermore, researchers, especially those who work on high-tech, would have wider range of references if they are good at English. Taking IT industry for an example, top technical science is published in English. It's neither to get a translated version of these articles, nor to always have a translator besides. As a result, they have no choice but choosing English as a second language.
 Admittedly, opponents may blame that English is making lesser-known languages disappear ever year. Hence, the culture heritage and nation identity vanish. However, this is really short-sighted, ignoring the rapid development of native economy and society.
 In conclusion, in spite of some negative effects, I'm totally convinced that the prevalent usage of English brings benefits to people and countries all around. I suggest all youths should learn English owing to its key role in globalization. But at the same time, actions, like recording, can be taken to protect native languages and cultures.
";"English is a language that has been used for centuries and has become a global language. It is the language of business, science, and communication, and it is the language of choice for many people around the world. English has become the language of choice for many people because of its advantages.
 
 The most obvious advantage of English is that it is a global language. English is the language of international business, science, and communication. It is the language of choice for many people around the world, and it is the language of choice for many international organizations. This means that English is the language of choice for many people when they are communicating with each other.
 
 Another advantage of English is that it is easy to learn. English is a relatively simple language to learn, and it is relatively easy to understand. This makes it easier for people to communicate with each other, even if they do not speak the same language.
 
 English is also the language of choice for many international organizations. This means that English is the language of choice for many international organizations, such as the United Nations and the European Union. This makes it easier for people to communicate with each other, even if they do not speak the same language.
 
 Finally, English is the language of choice for many people because of its cultural importance. English is the language of literature, music, and art, and it is the language of choice for many people when they are communicating with each other. This makes it easier for people to understand each other, even if they do not speak the same language.
 
 Despite these advantages, there are some disadvantages to using English as a global language. One of the main disadvantages is that it can be difficult for people to learn English if they do not have access to the right resources. English is a complex language, and it can be difficult to learn if people do not have access to the right resources.
 
 Another disadvantage of English is that it can be difficult for people to communicate with each other if they do not speak the same language. This can be a problem if people are trying to communicate with each other in a business setting, or if they are trying to communicate with each other in a social setting.
 
 Despite these disadvantages, the advantages of English outweigh the disadvantages. English is a global language, and it is the language of choice for many people around the world. It is the language of business, science, and communication, and it is the language of choice for many international organizations. English is also relatively easy to learn, and it is the language of choice for many people when they are communicating with each other. Finally, English is the language of choice for many people because of its cultural importance.
 
 Overall, the advantages of English outweigh the disadvantages. English is a global language, and it is the language of choice for many people around the world. It is the language of business, science, and communication, and it is the language of choice for many international organizations. English is also relatively easy to learn, and it is the language of choice for many people when they are communicating with each other. Finally, English is the language of choice for many people because of its cultural importance.";"English has been a universal language throughout the centuries and has been used as the medium of communication between different countries and cultures. It has become the language of science, business and politics, and is the official language in many countries. Its influence on the world is undeniable, and in many cases, its advantages outweigh its disadvantages. 
 
 One of the key advantages of English is that it is seen as a neutral language and therefore provides an effective way to bridge cultural and language barriers. Because English is spoken in many countries, it is often seen as a bridge to other cultures, allowing people to better understand each other. This has in turn enabled more effective communication and information exchange among different cultures, which has been a great advantage for the world.
 
 Furthermore, the widespread use of English has opened up many employment opportunities, as it has become an essential skill for many jobs. Having a good command of English has enabled people to access more opportunities and make more contacts in the global world. This has been especially beneficial for those who come from countries where English is not the primary language.
 
 Additionally, the use of English has enabled the spread of knowledge and expertise, both through the internet and through traditional forms of communication. With English serving as the language of technology, science and commerce, it has enabled people to understand and access a wealth of information. This has been especially important in the current digital age, as the internet has become a key source of knowledge and expertise.
 
 Finally, English has enabled a wider exchange of culture, which has been beneficial in terms of globalization. Through the use of English, people have been able to share their culture and values with each other, creating a more connected world. This has in turn enabled more understanding and acceptance of different cultures, leading to a more integrated and harmonious global society.
 
 In conclusion, the influence of English has been immense and has enabled the better exchange of information, culture and expertise throughout the world. Its advantages have undoubtedly outweighed the disadvantages, and it will continue to remain a key language for many years to come.";60;1818;3374;2322;2848.0
56;essay57.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/creativity-should-given-freedom-restrictions-26868/;creativity-should it be given freedom or restrictions;"Creativity is the ability to think beyond the obvious. Many governments restrict the artistic works of the creative minds. Creativity originates in a free mind. Hence, creative artists must be given the freedom to express their ideas without any restrictions.
 Time and again, creative artists like Michaelangelo, Picasso, Salman Rushdie, Shakespeare etc. have made artistic works which gave a social message. Right from sculptures to paintings, books to drama and movies, all these artistic works have reflected the contemporary social issues of different eras. Creative works help to create social awareness by giving a social message.
 Nonetheless, innovative works makes people realise things in a peaceful way and peep into their own conscience. It helps to raise issues and criticise the wrong doings of the governments. For instance, Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin was accused of acting against the government, just because she raised a social issue. This type of approach is a hurdle in promoting creative minds. In addition, creativity also gives aesthetic charm.
 Unfortunately, many governments restrict the artists. Frank Zappa once said, "" Mind is like a parachute, it doesn't work if its not open."" Restrictions would just curb the innovative ideas of the artists and would limit their brains. Like the media, artists should also be given the freedom to express their ideas freely.
 However, artists should also know not to hurt the sentiments of the people. Many artists have been involved in controversies because of hurting the religious or social beliefs of the common people. Artists should have self-awareness not to create vulgar, hurtful or useless works which do not serve any purpose. I firmly believe that artists should be given the freedom of expression. Mind can not work when it is chained in boundaries. Imagination is at its best when the mind is relaxed and free from the fear of government or any restrictive laws.
";"Creativity is a powerful tool that can be used to create something new and unique. It is a process of thinking outside the box and coming up with ideas that are not necessarily the norm. Creativity is an essential part of innovation and progress, and it should be given the freedom to explore and develop.
 
 Creativity should be given freedom because it allows people to think freely and come up with ideas that are not limited by the traditional boundaries of thought. It encourages people to think outside the box and come up with solutions to problems that may not have been considered before. It also allows people to explore different possibilities and come up with new and innovative ideas.
 
 However, creativity should also be given restrictions. Restrictions can help to ensure that the creative process is focused and that the ideas generated are practical and achievable. Restrictions can also help to ensure that the creative process is not wasted on ideas that are not feasible or that are not beneficial to the project.
 
 In conclusion, creativity should be given both freedom and restrictions. Freedom allows people to explore different possibilities and come up with new and innovative ideas. Restrictions help to ensure that the creative process is focused and that the ideas generated are practical and achievable. Both freedom and restrictions are necessary for creativity to be successful.";"Creativity is an essential part of a person's life and development. It is a tool for self-expression, problem solving, and personal growth. The debate over whether creativity should be given freedom or restrictions has been ongoing for quite some time. On the one hand, creativity should be allowed to flourish with minimal interference and restrictions so that individuals can explore and experience the creative process in its truest form. On the other hand, certain restrictions could help to channel one's creative energy and help to produce more meaningful and high-quality results. 
 
 One of the main arguments in favour of allowing complete freedom to creativity is that it encourages experimentation, exploration and innovation. Without restrictions and boundaries to contain creativity, people are more likely to explore, experiment and innovate in ways that produce unique and lasting results. Furthermore, providing freedom to creativity allows it to develop and evolve in fresh and unexpected ways. It also allows individuals to pursue their creative passions without fear of negative judgement or censorship, since they are not bound by the same rules and expectations that govern other aspects of life. 
 
 Despite the potential benefits of freedom, there are several reasons why creativity should have certain restrictions placed on it. Firstly, too much freedom can lead to unstructured expression and aimlessness. Without any sort of guidelines and parameters, one may struggle to stay focused and consistent in their creative pursuits. Additionally, it may be difficult for individuals to self-regulate and determine when to push boundaries and when to remain within certain accepted norms. In these circumstances, certain restrictions can help to provide focus and structure to creative pursuits, allowing individuals to more effectively explore and express their creativity. 
 
 Ultimately, the question of whether creativity should be given freedom or restrictions is a subjective one. While some may argue that creativity should be given full freedom and autonomy, others may believe that restrictions are necessary in order to produce high-quality work. Ultimately, the decision should be based on the individual's own preferences and goals and the context in which they are exploring their creativity. In this way, it is possible to both encourage creativity while also providing boundaries and guidance in order to channel creative energy and produce meaningful results.";53;1951;1411;2496;1953.5
57;essay58.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/competition-co-operation-better-26822/;competition or co-operation-which is better;"The modern society is full of cut-throat competition. Some people think that inculcating co-operative approach in a child is essential while some think that competing is the best way to succeed. However, co-operative approach always helps a child to become a responsible adult with good moral values and a friendly social circle.
 Co-operation is essential for teamwork. Educational systems emphasize on encouraging co-operative approach in children. We live in a social setup and mutual help and sharing only leads to success. A person can not learn or achieve everything by oneself. For instance, lions hunt in a team. It is only due to their teamwork that they are able to catch a prey and make task easy. In the same way, co-operative approach will save time, energy and will have a higher success rate.
 Nevertheless, co-operation helps to understand other's perspective and learn by their mistakes. It helps to identify one's strengths and weaknesses as compared to others. A co-operative approach can create inspirational and motivational feeling seeing other people's achievements. However, competition is also as important as co-operation.
 Unfortunately, the meaning of competion has been modified in a wrong direction. An individual must compete with oneself only, instead of trying to beat others. Competition has helped the development of science and technology. Competition helps in improvement and evolution. For example, every other day, new cars are developed by companies which are more efficient than others. This kind of competition gives customers more options.
 However, blind and selfish competition is detrimental. 'Your loss, my gain' kind of competition can never be fruitful in the long run. Competition should be always based on self-improvement rule. A healthy competition which involves raising one's own level above others is the best approach.
 Thus, competition and co-operation go hand in hand. These are two sides of the same coin which can't be seperated. I firmly believe that children should be taught co-operation complimented with a healthy competition. They must be made aware of the demerits of selfish competition. When co-operation and healthy competition is followed together, success, achievements, recognition and any goal becomes easier.
 
";"Competition or cooperation: which is better? This is a question that has been debated for centuries, and there is no single answer. Both competition and cooperation have their advantages and disadvantages, and the best approach depends on the situation.
 
 Competition is often seen as a way to motivate people to achieve their goals. It can create a sense of urgency and drive people to work harder and smarter. It can also lead to innovation and creativity, as people strive to be the best. Competition can also be beneficial in terms of economic growth, as it encourages businesses to strive for efficiency and productivity.
 
 However, competition can also have negative effects. It can lead to a sense of rivalry and hostility between individuals or groups, which can be damaging to relationships. It can also lead to a sense of insecurity and anxiety, as people worry about their performance and compare themselves to others.
 
 Cooperation, on the other hand, is often seen as a way to foster collaboration and teamwork. It encourages people to work together towards a common goal, and it can lead to greater understanding and respect between individuals. Cooperation can also lead to greater efficiency, as people can share resources and ideas to achieve their goals.
 
 Ultimately, the best approach depends on the situation. In some cases, competition may be the best way to motivate people and drive innovation. In other cases, cooperation may be the best way to foster collaboration and teamwork. It is important to consider the context and the goals of the situation before deciding which approach is best.";"?
 
 Competition and cooperation each serve distinct purposes, making it difficult to answer which is better. The best course of action is to determine which serves a given situation better. To do this, one needs to consider the goals of the situation and evaluate whether competition or cooperation is best suited to achieving them.
 
 At its core, competition is the concept of striving to become the best. Through competition, individuals or groups attempt to outperform each other in order to gain an advantage. This competitive drive can lead to innovation and creativity as it motivates performing better than ones peers. Furthermore, competition allowed for the development of capitalism and global markets that support economic growth and development.
 
 In contrast, cooperation is the idea of working towards a common goal as a team. Through cooperation, individuals come together to share resources and skills to cooperate in the production of a  better output. This approach allows for the efficiency of large-scale production and encourages creative problem-solving and collaboration. Additionally, cooperation allows for collective bargaining and collective action.
 
 When considering which approach is better, it must be considered whether ones goals are best served through collaboration or competition. If the goal is to spur innovation and creativity, then competition may be a better approach. On the other hand, if the goal is to maximize production or collective action, then cooperation may be the best option. In some cases, it may be beneficial to use both approaches in combination.
 
 In conclusion, while competition and cooperation have distinct advantages and disadvantages, neither is necessarily better in all cases. The best approach is to examine the goals of a particular situation and determine which approach is best suited to achieving them. In this way, it is possible to maximize the positive effects of each approach and use them in combination as necessary.";43;2288;1619;1999;1809.0
58;essay59.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/capital-punishment-necessary-not-26702/;capital punishment..necessary or not;"Crime is always punishable. Retribution is the method for countering criminals. Some countries have stringent rules, like capital punishment, while other have a lot of flexibility in the judicial system. However, strict laws, like capital punishment, are essential in a society.
 Capital punishment is given only in the "" rarest of the rare"" cases. Its first and foremost objective is safety of other human beings. When a criminal becomes a threat to the society, such that they can commit heinous crimes, then they are given capital punishment. Thus, capital punishment protects the society from hardcore criminals.
 Moreover, capital punishment curbs the inspiration and prospects of other hateful crimes. When a criminal mind knows the quantum of punishment, they will fear and not commit such crimes. Thus, the rate of crime and violence is effectively decreased.
 Importantly, capital punishment saves a lot of government funding which is wasted in maintenance of these hardcore criminals. Criminals who don't have any chance of improvement or who have a past record of such crimes are, therefore, given capital punishment.
 However, the jury giving the verdict are also humans. They have the life of a person at their discretion. They can make mistakes which can sometimes affect an innocent, circumstantially marred criminals. The jury must therefore, take into account the circumstances of committing a crime. For example, if an individual murders someone for self-defence, then such a crime is not heinous. Only deserving criminals, who commit such hateful crimes in their proper senses are subjected to capital punishment.
 Capital punishment is essential to control violence in the society. I firmly believe that psychopaths, terrorists or any other criminal who lacks empathy for other human lives deserve capital punishment. Capital punishment helps to safeguard human rights in a strict and effective manner. However, it should be considered as the last option by the jury and all circumstances must be taken into account before pronouncing the final verdict.
";"Capital punishment, also known as the death penalty, is the most severe form of punishment for criminal offenses. It is a controversial topic that has been debated for centuries, and opinions on the matter are divided. Some people believe that capital punishment is necessary in order to deter crime and protect society, while others argue that it is an inhumane and ineffective form of punishment.
 
 Proponents of capital punishment argue that it is a necessary tool for deterring crime. They argue that the threat of the death penalty is a powerful deterrent that can prevent people from committing serious crimes. They also point out that it can provide closure for victims and their families, as well as justice for the victims.
 
 On the other hand, opponents of capital punishment argue that it is an inhumane and ineffective form of punishment. They point out that it is irreversible and can lead to the execution of innocent people. They also argue that there is no evidence to suggest that it is an effective deterrent, and that it is more expensive than other forms of punishment.
 
 In conclusion, the debate over capital punishment is complex and highly contested. While some people believe that it is necessary in order to deter crime and provide justice for victims, others argue that it is an inhumane and ineffective form of punishment. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to use capital punishment should be left up to the individual states and countries.";"Capital punishment, also known as the death penalty, is a highly controversial and divisive topic in the United States, with opinions ranging from support for the practice to complete opposition. Throughout history, capital punishment has been used as an effective deterrent for certain heinous crimes. In modern times, many legal systems now take other factors into account before implementing the death penalty, such as the mental health and age of the accused. Although some people may view it as a necessary form of justice, the use of capital punishment raises several ethical, moral and legal questions.
 
 Proponents of capital punishment often argue that it is the only way to ensure that criminals are justly and fully punished for their crimes. They believe that the death penalty provides a sense of closure to victims and their families, serves as a deterrent to potential criminals, and prevents criminals from being released and committing more crimes. These arguments, while compelling, fail to take into account the potential for wrongful execution and the overall costs of capital punishment.
 
 Opponents of capital punishment point to the high costs of executing an individual, which can include legal and court costs, appeals, and the expense of keeping a convict on death row for decades. Furthermore, there is no scientific evidence to suggest that the death penalty serves as a deterrent to potential criminals. Opponents also cite the possibility of wrongful execution due to inadequate legal representation or false evidence.
 
 From an ethical point of view, opponents of capital punishment argue that it is a violation of the right to life, a basic human right. As such, no matter how heinous the crime, the state does not have the right to take the life of an individual. In addition, opponents argue that capital punishment fails to recognize an individuals potential for redemption or rehabilitation and contributes to a dehumanizing atmosphere within the criminal justice system.
 
 At the end of the day, the death penalty is a highly personal decision. While it is true that capital punishment has been used since the dawn of civilization, its ethical, moral and legal implications are too serious to be taken lightly. If a society is to maintain a moral code and promote justice, it is important to consider all of the arguments both for and against the death penalty before making a decision.";36;2074;1480;2427;1953.5
59;essay60.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/is-break-good-bad-after-high-school-students-26657/;is a break good or bad after high school for students;"Studies are an essential part of life.Some countries permit students to take a break from studies between high school and university studies, while in some countries, it is considered as waste of time. However, a break of one year is good for young people after finishing their high school.
 In most education systems, a child studies continously from the age of 5 till 16 years of age. A relaxation of one year to young minds will give them a quintessential change. A continous study pressure for over 10 years makes the mind saturated and like a robot, to follow instructions. Personally, a break will give students some time to refresh their systems, by travelling or following their hobbies. Importantly, when students start their university studies after a break, they will feel fresh and full of energy to take the new challenge.
 Nevertheless, during high school, many students face a dilemma to decide which stream should they major in. Working or travelling for some time, after high school, can help them to find their field of interest. It will also help them to learn professional setup by working. Financially,students can save a little money to support their university education by doing a job. Some students even utilise this time for preparation of their desired university course.
 However, there are also disadvantages. A break can disturb the focus of students and prove detrimental. When students work during these breaks, the feel of money gives them an illusion that such salary is enough for them and they go in a utopia. For instance, my cousin started working in a customer care centre after high school and got distracted. When he started his university studies, he failed miserably. Students can also indulge in smoking or drinking during this time. But , the break should be an optional thing. It varies from individual to individual, how they utilise that period. A break gives students more benefits than harms.
 Importantly, the sole purpose of education is to nurture a young mind and not thrust studies on them. Thus, a break should be necessarily allowed to young minds between their high school and university studies. Countries, like India, where such a break is considered a blot, should understand that young minds are delicate and they face a cut-throat competition. One year break can help young people to prepare for the challenges of life.
";"A break after high school is a highly debated topic among students, parents, and educators. On one hand, some argue that a break is beneficial for students, allowing them to take a break from the rigors of school and explore their interests and passions. On the other hand, some argue that a break can be detrimental, leading to a lack of motivation and focus, and ultimately, a lack of success in college and beyond.
 
 Proponents of a break after high school argue that it is beneficial for students to take a break and explore their interests and passions. A break can provide students with the opportunity to travel, volunteer, or pursue a job or internship. These experiences can help students gain valuable skills and knowledge, as well as provide them with a better understanding of the world and their place in it. Additionally, a break can provide students with the opportunity to take a step back and reflect on their goals and aspirations. This can help them gain clarity and focus on their future plans.
 
 Opponents of a break after high school argue that it can lead to a lack of motivation and focus. They argue that taking a break can lead to a lack of academic progress, as students may become complacent and lose their drive to succeed. Additionally, opponents argue that a break can lead to a lack of preparation for college, as students may not have the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in college-level courses.
 
 Ultimately, the decision to take a break after high school is a personal one. It is important for students to consider their individual goals and aspirations, as well as the potential benefits and drawbacks of taking a break. For some students, a break may be beneficial, while for others, it may be detrimental. Ultimately, it is up to the student to decide what is best for them.";"In recent years, the debate about whether taking a break after high school is a good or bad idea for students has been a topic of much discussion. On one hand, some argue that taking a break from formal education is beneficial, providing students with a chance to explore the world and potential career paths, or to simply rest and recharge, before continuing their education. On the other hand, those who argue against taking a break maintain that students should instead continue their education, as any delay is likely to lessen the chances of success. 
 
 At the end of the day, the decision to take a break after high school really depends on the individual student and their particular goals, circumstances, and interests. Even though many students feel pressured to immediately attend college upon graduating high school, they should remember that taking a break is a perfectly valid option, and one that may even benefit them in the long run. 
 
 There are several advantages to taking a break after high school. Doing so gives students a chance to explore the world, and determine which career path they may be interested in pursuing. It provides a period of rest and relaxation, and allows them to experience life outside of the academic environment. Taking a break may also allow young adults to gain valuable life experience, including working and earning money, as well as developing important skills and learning more about themselves. 
 
 On the other hand, there are potential disadvantages to taking a break. It can lead to students feeling disconnected and out of touch with academic life, making it harder for them to transition back once theyre ready to resume their studies. It can also lead to a loss of motivation and focus, making it difficult for them to stay on track and complete a degree. Finally, theres the issue of finances, as taking a break doesnt often come with financial aid or other forms of assistance to help get them through college. 
 
 In conclusion, taking a break after high school is a highly-personal decision that should be made on a case-by-case basis. While there are certain risks associated with taking a break, it can also be a valuable opportunity for exploration and growth. Ultimately, the best decision is whatever will bring the student success and fulfillment in the long run.";53;2383;1826;2334;2080.0

Ever since Charles Babbage (know as ""Father of computers"") invented computers, its development never had a pause. The whole world is dependent on computers, without which, the world will go back hundreds of years.
 In the modern world, computers are used everywhere. Right from flying planes to sending a small document, computers are needed. They are used in space programmes , wars, hospitals, schools and so on. Computers have made human life more easy, convenient and lightning fast. For example, in earlier days , if one had to send a message to someone in other country, it used to take months. But today, it can be sent in few minutes by typing a email and few clicks. Computers provide speed, increase efficiency, accuracy, precision, help to increase productivity and other countless benefits are provided by it.
 Moreover, future prospects of computers are very bright. From a computer as big as a room, it has now been minimized to the size of a palm. Nanotechnology is working to make computers to the order of microscopic levels. Research on making computerised drone soldiers (unmanned computer controlled) is going on. There is no end to the evolution of computers.
 However, everything has pros and cons. Computers have made humans over-dependent. Virus programs, privacy breach, leak of confidential documents, cyber attacks, identity theft, frauds etc. are some of its demerits, from a countless list. Computers expose children to vulgar materials. They have even invaded mental health of humans, for example , FAD (Facebook Addiction Disorder- excessive use of social networking website Facebook). Computers have intruded our lives to the effect that a satellite can peep into our homes and privates lives. The recent case of Wikileaks , leaking confidential data is an example of how computers are harmful.
 Nevertheless, with all the mentioned demerits, computers have provided security and sophistication too. Thus, dependence on computers is not a bad thing. However, one needs to be aware of all the pros and cons and beware of malicious things. Computer was invented for the benefit of mankind and it has fulfilled its objective. Human life today can't be imagined without computers, so not depending on them is out of question.
";"Computers have become an integral part of our lives. They are used in almost every aspect of our lives, from the home to the workplace. Computers have revolutionized the way we work, communicate, and even entertain ourselves.
 
 The use of computers has made life easier in many ways. We can now access information from all over the world with just a few clicks of a mouse. We can also use computers to store and organize data, making it easier to find what we need. Computers have also made communication easier, allowing us to stay in touch with friends and family around the world.
 
 The future prospects of computers are even more exciting. With the development of artificial intelligence, computers are becoming increasingly capable of performing complex tasks. This could lead to computers being used in a variety of fields, from medicine to finance. Computers could also be used to automate many of the mundane tasks that take up our time, freeing us up to focus on more important things.
 
 However, there is a downside to the increased use of computers. People can become overly dependent on computers, leading to a lack of critical thinking skills. This can lead to people relying too heavily on computers to make decisions, which can be dangerous.
 
 In conclusion, computers have revolutionized the way we work, communicate, and entertain ourselves. They have made life easier in many ways, and the future prospects of computers are even more exciting. However, people should be aware of the potential dangers of over-dependence on computers.";"Computers have become an essential part of everyday life, providing convenience and increased efficiency in many areas. They have revolutionized the way we work and communicate, and they continue to do so with their ever-evolving capabilities. In this essay, I will discuss the uses of computers, their future prospects, and the potential pitfalls of over-dependence on them.
 
 Computers are extensively used in almost every modern industry for a variety of tasks. In medicine, for example, computers provide advanced diagnostic tools, patient records and histories, and innovative treatments. In the business world, computers manage data, process financial information, and generate reports. Computers are also used to create graphics and animations for entertainment, marketing, and education.
 
 The future of computers is one of even greater integration into our lives. Already, computers are becoming smaller, faster, and more powerful. This advancement is leading to the development of robots and artificial intelligence that can complete complex tasks that were previously impossible or too costly. Augmented reality, virtual reality, and the Internet of Things are examples of how computers are becoming more and more interconnected with our daily lives.
 
 However, there are potential pitfalls to over-dependence on computers. Computers are created by humans, and as a result can be subject to human error. They can also be vulnerable to cyber-attacks, which can cost organizations and individuals billions of dollars. Moreover, over-dependence on computers can lead to a reduction in critical thinking and problem solving skills, as people become reliant on technology to do their work.
 
 Overall, computers have become an integral part of everyday life. They provide increased efficiency in almost every area and their capabilities are continuously expanding. But, with increased benefits also come potential risks from over-reliance on computers. Thus, it is important to develop strategies to limit the risks of over-dependence and to ensure that humans retain their creative and critical thinking abilities.";51;2329;1555;2124;1839.5
61;essay62.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/should-universities-accept-equal-number-males-females-not-26654/;should universities accept equal number of males/females or not;"Education is important for the development of the world. Its a debatable issue whether universities should accept equal number of males and females in a course or not. However, since both genders are equally important, both must be given equal opportunities. Universities must admit both in equal numbers, depending on their choices.
 Right to education is a basic human right of both, males and females. The whole world aims for women empowerment, and to achieve this, females should be given equal opportunities as males. When universities will accept them in equal number, both genders will be able to nurture their talent and a healthy competitive environment will develop.
 Co-education helps both genders to gel well with each other. It helps them how to behave and cooperate and work together. For example, students studying in boy's colleges do not generally know how to talk to a female or behave in front of them. On the other hand, females studying in girl's colleges are too shy to face boys. Co-education will help to eradicate this kind of demerit in both. Universities giving both genders equal opportunities, will prepare then for future challenges and will help in the long run.
 Unfortunately, some male chauvinists think that women are incapable in particular fields, like maths, mechanical engineering, defence etc. This kind of gender biased approach is detrimental for the development of the society. Time and again, women have proved their mettle in every field. Women like Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, Mari Curie etc., are symbols of women's intelligence and skills.
 Thus, I firmly believe that both genders have equal rights and universities should accept them in equal numbers. Equality in education will help in development of the society.Both genders are the fulcrum of the society and none of them is superior or inferior. Choice of course should be the discretion of the student and their merit, irrespective of the gender. Educational rights must be given to both genders.
";"The debate over whether universities should accept an equal number of males and females has been ongoing for many years. On one hand, proponents of gender equality argue that universities should strive to achieve a balance between male and female students in order to promote gender equality and provide equal opportunities for both genders. On the other hand, opponents of this idea argue that universities should not be required to accept equal numbers of males and females, as this could lead to a decrease in the quality of education and could lead to a decrease in the overall academic standards of the university.
 
 Proponents of gender equality argue that universities should strive to achieve a balance between male and female students in order to promote gender equality and provide equal opportunities for both genders. They argue that universities should strive to create an environment where both genders are equally represented and respected. This would create a more inclusive and diverse learning environment, which would benefit both genders. Furthermore, proponents argue that universities should strive to create an environment where both genders are equally represented in terms of faculty, staff, and student body. This would ensure that both genders are equally represented in terms of leadership positions, research opportunities, and other opportunities.
 
 Opponents of this idea argue that universities should not be required to accept equal numbers of males and females, as this could lead to a decrease in the quality of education and could lead to a decrease in the overall academic standards of the university. They argue that universities should be allowed to accept students based on their academic merit and not on their gender. Furthermore, opponents argue that universities should not be forced to accept an equal number of males and females, as this could lead to a decrease in the overall quality of education.
 
 In conclusion, universities should strive to achieve a balance between male and female students in order to promote gender equality and provide equal opportunities for both genders. However, universities should not be required to accept equal numbers of males and females, as this could lead to a decrease in the overall quality of education. Ultimately, universities should be allowed to accept students based on their academic merit and not on their gender.";"For centuries, the debate over whether universities should accept equal numbers of males and females has been a complex and controversial one. On the one hand, it is difficult to argue against the idea that universities should strive for equal representation for both genders in order to make sure that everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed. On the other hand, it is important to recognize that there is nothing that states that the genders must be represented in equal numbers in order to have success. Therefore, it is important to consider the various arguments when making the decision whether universities should accept an equal number of males and females.
 
 The first argument in favor of accepting equal numbers of males and females is that it would ensure that all genders have access to the same opportunities and resources. It is important to create an environment in which everyone has access to the same educational possibilities without discrimination. This means that if universities accepted equal numbers of males and females, they would be more likely to provide equal access to resources, faculty, and courses. This is an important step in making sure that everyone has the ability to get the most out of their college experience.
 
 However, many people are against the idea of accepting equal numbers of males and females due to the idea that there is no need to force equality. These individuals argue that there are many factors that contribute to success and that individuals should be allowed to make decisions based on these factors rather than based on predetermined gender quotas. They also argue that accepting equal numbers of males and females could lead to unfair treatment in some cases, as universities may be less likely to accept applicants from underrepresented genders if they do not fit into the predetermined quotas.
 
 Ultimately, the decision of whether universities should accept equal numbers of males and females should be based on individual circumstances. If there is a clear need for greater representation of one gender, then it would be wise to take steps to ensure that the university reflects that. However, if there is not a need for this type of representation, then it is important to consider the potential drawbacks of forcing such a system. It is essential that universities keep in mind the various arguments surrounding this issue and make decisions on a case-by-case basis.";63;2010;2410;2442;2426.0
62;essay63.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/task-people-spend-less-time-cooking-food-28132/;people will spend less time on cooking food;"Perhaps, no issue in this world is as significant to people as cooking food, because it affects everybody in their daily lives. Some people hold the opinion that people should spend much time on food. However, I do think that people are likely to spend less time in cooking food. There are various reasons why I maintain this viewpoint, and among those reasons are two important ones.
 The first and foremost reason is that with the development of science and technology, more advanced kitchen facilities, such as the modern microwaves or the advanced pressure cookers, have been created and invented to help people prepare and cook food in a very short time. As a result, people nowadays just spend one hour to prepare a meal instead of two, even three hours like in the last 10 years. Actually, in recent years, there was a significant increase in the number of people from all walks of life realizing this valueable benefit of those technologies in doing their housework. And this figure still continueously go up along with the improvement of science and technology. Thus, it is certain that spending less time on cooking will be the main trend in near future.
 Another reason is that most of young people prefer to have meals at restaurants because they want to invest more time in their work or study to improve themselves. According to a recent survey, 89% of people have come to think that, since they have been put in the situation which is filled with competitions and pressures, they have to use a lot of time to work hard, to update themselves, to acquire all kinds of skills and so on. Thus, they find hard to have time to prepare and cook a meal. Even they have some spare time, they prefer to go out with friends to relax and relieve the pressure from work and study.
 Some people may argue that investing much time in cooking food will guarantee nutrition as well as quality of food for their family. To some extent, it is true. However, as a matter of fact, using technology or advanced facilities do not make food lose its nutrition and quality. Even, with the help of ozone machines, bacterias, mold spores, or pesticide in vegetables, fruits and foods will be killed and removed, thus health and life of eaters is assured. Besides, along with the high living standard, requirements of quality products in almost restaurants, nowadays, are under severe control and supervision by appropriate authorities. Consequently, it is quite easy to have a nutritious meal with guaranteed quality, but do not waste a lot of time.
 To sum up, if all those factors are contemplated, it is obviously found that there are many solid reasons to support my viewpoint. So, from what have been discussed above, I strongly affirm the conclusion that people will spend less time in cooking food.
";"In recent years, the amount of time people spend on cooking food has been decreasing. This is due to a variety of factors, such as the rise of convenience foods, the increased availability of take-out and delivery options, and the emergence of new kitchen appliances and gadgets that make cooking easier and faster.
 
 Convenience foods have become increasingly popular in recent years. These are pre-packaged meals that require minimal preparation, such as microwavable meals, frozen dinners, and canned goods. These foods are often cheaper and faster to prepare than traditional home-cooked meals, making them attractive to busy individuals who dont have the time or energy to cook from scratch.
 
 Take-out and delivery options have also become more popular in recent years. Restaurants and fast-food chains now offer delivery services, allowing customers to have their meals brought to their door. This is a great option for those who dont have the time or energy to cook, as it eliminates the need to go out and purchase ingredients and spend time preparing a meal.
 
 Finally, new kitchen appliances and gadgets have made cooking easier and faster. Pressure cookers, slow cookers, and air fryers are just a few examples of the appliances that have become popular in recent years. These appliances allow users to prepare meals quickly and with minimal effort, making them attractive to those who dont have the time or energy to spend hours in the kitchen.
 
 Overall, it is clear that people are spending less time on cooking food. This is due to the rise of convenience foods, the increased availability of take-out and delivery options, and the emergence of new kitchen appliances and gadgets that make cooking easier and faster. As a result, individuals are able to enjoy delicious meals without having to spend hours in the kitchen.";"Cooking has been an integral part of our lives since the dawn of civilization, however, due to recent advancements in food technology, the amount of time the average person is spending on cooking food is rapidly decreasing.
 
 One of the primary reasons behind this is the increasing numbers of convenient and easy-to-cook options available in the market. From frozen pizzas to microwaveable meals to ready-to-eat snacks, people now have access to a variety of pre-prepared meals that require minimal effort to prepare. As a result, more and more people are opting for these convenient options rather than spending precious time in the kitchen.
 
 Another major contributor to this growing trend is the influx of food delivery and takeout services. Platforms such as UberEats, Grubhub, and PostMates have made it incredibly easy for people to have their favorite restaurant meals delivered to their doorstep. From fast-food chains to high-end restaurants, people now have access to almost any type of cuisine without ever having to step out of their home.
 
 Apart from that, the advent of cooking appliances such as electric pressure cookers, slow cookers, and air fryers have saved people a great deal of time and money. These electric appliances are user friendly and allow users to whip up a dish in no time.
 
 Overall, there is no denying that people are spending less time on cooking food in recent years. This is largely due to the availability of a wide range of convenient and easy-to-cook options, food delivery services, as well as cooking appliances. While cooking has its own joys, this trend is likely to continue in the future, with more and more people opting for convenience over traditional methods of cooking.";43;2794;1841;1729;1785.0
63;essay64.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/traditional-games-modern-games-developing-children-s-skills-28714/;Traditional games or modern games in developing children's skills;"Games have played a key role in children's growth, especially in terms of their abilities. With technological advances, children have more access to modern games currently. In such case, the relative importance of traditional games and modern games in children's developments of skills has become a frequent topic of discussion. For me, I believe parents and educators should attach more importance to traditional games.
 It is true that modern games may be, to some extent, beneficial for children to foster some skills, such as computer skills or the capacity to keep up with the latest trend. This is because children have to be proficient at computers and the Internet if they want to join online games, which, in fact, helps children acquire a particularly powerful skill at work in future. At the same time, children have the chance to experience the state-of-the-art technology, raising their awareness of innovation rather than stay conservative.
 However, I think traditional games are still indispensible in children's learning process, even much more essential than modern games, especially in modern society. One primary merit of traditional games is that they foster children's communication skills. Unlike most modern games which focus on the interactions between children and machines, traditional games provide a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere where children can chat, laugh and cooperate face to face. As a result, communicating with a variety of people will not be an issue for these children any more.
 Furthermore, it is the educational functions traditional games hold that keep them alive today. In fact, these traditional games were elaborately devised by educators and have been proven effective in improving children's skills on different aspects in previous teaching practices. By contrast, modern games are developed by game companies for the purpose of profits. Therefore, there is a risk that children may be exposed to unhealthy contents, such as violence or pornography, arranged in the games by such companies to secure financial survival.
 Thus, I would conclude that traditional games should be, by no means, ignored by parents and teachers with the advent of modern games. Only through traditional games can children be ensured a positive and healthy skills learning process.
";"The debate between traditional games and modern games in developing children's skills has been ongoing for many years. Traditional games have been around for centuries, while modern games are relatively new. Both types of games have their advantages and disadvantages when it comes to developing children's skills.
 
 Traditional games are often seen as a more natural way of developing children's skills. They are often played outdoors and involve physical activity, which can help children to develop their physical skills. Traditional games also often involve social interaction, which can help children to develop their social skills. Additionally, traditional games often require children to use their imagination, which can help to develop their creative skills.
 
 On the other hand, modern games can also be beneficial for developing children's skills. Modern games often involve technology, which can help children to develop their technical skills. Additionally, modern games often involve problem-solving, which can help children to develop their cognitive skills. Furthermore, modern games often involve competition, which can help children to develop their competitive skills.
 
 Ultimately, both traditional games and modern games can be beneficial for developing children's skills. Traditional games can help to develop physical, social, and creative skills, while modern games can help to develop technical, cognitive, and competitive skills. Therefore, it is important for parents to provide their children with a variety of both traditional and modern games in order to ensure that they are able to develop a wide range of skills.";"Traditional games or modern games in developing children's skills is a debate that has been going on for years. While advocates for traditional games argue that playing games the old-fashioned way are more beneficial for childrens physical, mental and social development, supporters of modern games argue that digital technologies are the way of the future and can bring even more to the table. 
 
 Traditional games such as hide-and-seek, tag, hopscotch and hopscotch have been around for centuries and have been a major source of entertainment for generations of children. When playing these games, children learn important skills like teamwork, strategy, communication and independence. These games also require children to use their imagination and to think on their feet, which can lead to improved problem-solving and creative thinking. Furthermore, these activities can help to improve physical health and endurance, as they require a lot of physical activity and they can also help to improve coordination. 
 
 On the other hand, supporters of modern games argue that the introduction of digital technologies has opened the door to many new and exciting opportunities for children's skill development. With modern games, children can have access to games with virtual reality graphics, immersive storylines, and even artificial intelligence that can interact with the players. These types of games can help to promote problem-solving and critical thinking skills, as well as creativity and innovation. Additionally, these games can often help children to improve their hand-eye coordination and motor skills, as they require players to navigate complex virtual environments and make quick decisions while they play. 
 
 Ultimately, both traditional and modern games can be beneficial for childrens skill development, but the type of game that is more beneficial will depend on the individual child. For example, some children are more likely to benefit from traditional games that require physical activity, while others may be more likely to benefit from the immersive experiences and problem-solving challenges that modern games provide. Ultimately, it is important for parents and educators to observe their children and see which type of game works best for their individual needs.";65;2314;1648;2293;1970.5
64;essay65.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/government-shouldn-t-put-money-building-theaters-sports-28690/;government shouldn't put money on building theaters or sports stadiums;"How to allocate governmental budget efficiently has always been a hot topic of discussion among the public. Recently, some people argue that government should invest more on medical care and education rather than on entertaining or sports facilities. As far as I am concerned, this proposal is beneficial more to the society.
 Taking care of thousands of citizens who suffer from disease or illiteracy is more urgent and pragmatic than building theaters or sports stadiums. As a matter of fact, an uneducated person may barely appreciate musicals, whereas a physical damaged person, resulting from the lack of medical treatment, may no longer participate in any sports games. Therefore, providing education and medical care is more essential and prioritized to the government.
 Entertaining facilities such as cinemas, theaters and sports stadiums are mostly profit-oriented. Their existences are based on their marketing strategies, the condition of facilities and the volume of audience. The competition among each of these facilities is an inevitable part of the free market, which should not be interfered by government. Instead, the establishment of medical facilities or educational institutes is aimed to improve the health or education standard rather than earning profits, which deserves more funds from government.
 Furthermore, putting taxpayers' money on building theaters or sports stadiums is unfair to those who cannot use them. For example, not everyone is a fan of watching musicals on the spot. Therefore, it is a bit inappropriate to use the majority of citizens' tax funds to meet a minority of people's needs. That is the reason why sectors such as medical care and education deserve more governmental support, because they are accessed by every individual in our society on a daily basis.
 To summarize, I strongly agree that budgets should be allocated more on medical care and education rather than on building entertaining facilities, because the former is more essential, non-profit oriented to the public and can be accessed by the majority of citizens.
";"The government should not put money into building theaters or sports stadiums. This is because the money could be better used in other areas that would benefit the public more. For example, the money could be used to fund education, health care, or infrastructure projects. These are all areas that would benefit the public more than building theaters or sports stadiums.
 
 Theaters and sports stadiums are not essential to the public. They are luxuries that people can choose to pay for if they want to. The government should not be using taxpayer money to fund these luxuries. It should be using the money to fund essential services that benefit everyone.
 
 Theaters and sports stadiums also do not create jobs. While they may create some temporary jobs during the construction phase, these jobs are not long-term. The money spent on building these facilities could be used to create more permanent jobs in other areas.
 
 Theaters and sports stadiums also do not generate revenue for the government. They are not a source of income for the government. The money spent on building them is money that is gone forever. The government could use this money to invest in projects that would generate revenue for the government.
 
 In conclusion, the government should not put money into building theaters or sports stadiums. This money could be better used in other areas that would benefit the public more. These areas include education, health care, and infrastructure projects. Theaters and sports stadiums are not essential to the public and do not create jobs or generate revenue for the government.";"The government should not be using finite taxpayer dollars to put towards the building and upkeep of theaters and sports stadiums. While these things can bring entertainment, joy, and money to a community, the effects are often far more short-term than the money used to fund them involves. Taxpayers already face burdensome taxes with limited money to put into infrastructure; spending money on theaters and sports stadiums is not a wise decision when there are more beneficial things to put money into that will help the community in the long-term.
 
 The importance of infrastructure should never be underestimated. A crumbling road system and substandard utilities are often just as costly as putting money into sports stadiums. These basic services help promote commerce and the health of citizens, and should be given first priority. Poor roads and faulty infrastructure can take its toll on citizens, causing accidents or health problems. This can lead to higher insurance costs and medical bills, which can be damaging to both the government and its citizens.
 
 Another option for taxpayer money is to invest in programs and services that create better access to opportunities. Education, job-training, and healthcare are important in any society; yet, these programs are often underfunded or unutilized. Focusing taxpayer money on these initiatives can create jobs, and give individuals a chance to reach their goals. Investing in such programs can have a positive, long-term impact on a community, and can also help create an environment of opportunity that encourages growth and prosperity.
 
 In addition, government should put money into green initiatives and renewable energy. With global warming and climate change becoming more and more pressing, the need for clean energy sources has never been greater. Investing in renewable energy sources will not only benefit the environment, but also create jobs and reduce the burden of energy costs for citizens.
 
 The building and upkeep of theaters and sports stadiums should not be a priority for taxpayer money. There are more important places to put our finite resources, such as in infrastructure, education, and renewable energy sources. Investing in these initiatives can have far reaching and long-term effects on a community, and this should be the focus of government spending.";70;2081;1603;2348;1975.5
65;essay66.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/technology-keeps-traditional-skills-ways-life-alive-not-28686/;Technology keeps traditional skills and ways of life alive or not?;"Living in the 21st century, people are firmly convinced that technology is the main driving force behind productivity. Thus, every country has been promoting technological advances in the recent years, regardless of any potential problems it may bring about. Some people are worried modern technological technology is probably a hurdle to the preservation of traditional techniques and lifestyles. However, I believe their concern is groundless. Instead, technology plays a key role in promoting traditional techniques and lifestyles.
 In terms of time and space, technology makes it more efficient and effective to promote the traditional skills and ways of life. In the past, only when people went to the local place could they experience the specific traditional lifestyles. This means individuals who were engaged in work and therefore could not spare time to travel or restricted by traffic conditions had to miss the chance to appreciate the traditional skills. However, with the access to the Internet, one of the greatest innovations in modern society, humankind can acquire the traditional techniques displayed online anytime, anywhere.
 Additionally, technology enriches the way of displaying traditional cultural heritage, making it more vivid and appealing. For example, China has successfully promoted traditional techniques in the Shanghai World Expo, using a variety of state-of –the-art technological methods, such as robots and LED screens. In fact, many tourists around the world marveled at the perfect synthesis of the modern technology and the traditional culture.
 On the other hand, some people are concerned that technology may have a detrimental effect on the traditional lifestyles. They argue that people, especially youngsters, are crazier about fresh and advanced things, such as digital products, thus becoming indifferent to traditional techniques. But I believe this is not the issue because people tend to follow the trend back to the tradition in the recent years.
 Therefore, I will conclude that technology indeed supports the preservation and promotion of traditional techniques and lifestyles. Only when traditional culture is integrated with the modern technology can it be developed in the long run.
";"Technology has become an integral part of our lives, and it has revolutionized the way we live. It has enabled us to do things faster, more efficiently, and more conveniently. But, has technology kept traditional skills and ways of life alive? This essay will explore this question by looking at both the positive and negative impacts of technology on traditional skills and ways of life.
 
 On the positive side, technology has enabled traditional skills and ways of life to be preserved and shared with future generations. For example, the internet has allowed people to access and share information about traditional skills and ways of life, such as recipes, crafts, and cultural practices. This has enabled people to learn and practice these skills and ways of life, even if they are not able to experience them first-hand. Technology has also enabled people to access and share resources, such as tools and materials, which can be used to practice traditional skills and ways of life.
 
 On the negative side, technology has also had a detrimental effect on traditional skills and ways of life. For example, the prevalence of technology has led to a decrease in the demand for traditional skills and ways of life. This has led to a decrease in the number of people practicing these skills and ways of life, which has resulted in a decrease in the knowledge and expertise associated with them. Additionally, technology has enabled people to access and share information about traditional skills and ways of life without having to practice them. This has led to a decrease in the appreciation for the hard work and dedication required to master these skills and ways of life.
 
 In conclusion, technology has both positive and negative impacts on traditional skills and ways of life. On the one hand, it has enabled these skills and ways of life to be preserved and shared with future generations. On the other hand, it has also had a detrimental effect on them, leading to a decrease in the demand for and appreciation of them. Ultimately, it is up to individuals to decide whether or not they want to use technology to keep traditional skills and ways of life alive.";"Technology has had an immense effect on the way we interact with our environment and the traditional skills and ways of life that have been passed down for generations. While technology has brought us amazing advances and efficiencies in many areas, it can also pose a threat to our traditional skills and ways of life.
 
 The traditional way of life is based on sustainability and balance with the environment. When technology is introduced, it often disrupts this balance, resulting in the displacement of traditional knowledge and ways of life. For example, the introduction of technology in the form of factory farming has replaced traditional agricultural methods in many parts of the world, resulting in the loss of traditional farming knowledge, practices, and values. Additionally, technology is increasingly replacing manual labor, eliminating a way of life that has been in place for centuries.
 
 However, technology also has the potential to keep traditional skills and ways of life alive. By making use of modern technology, traditional skills and knowledge can be preserved and shared with the world. For example, websites and digital archives can be used to document and preserve the stories, craftsmanship, and skills of a particular culture or community. Additionally, digital tools such as 3D printing and computer-aided design can be used to create updated versions of traditional tools and products.
 
 Ultimately, the use of technology to keep traditional skills and ways of life alive is largely dependent on how it is used. If it is used to disrespect traditional knowledge and ways of life, it can lead to the destruction of those ways of life. However, if technology is used to enhance traditional skills and knowledge, it can be a powerful tool for preserving and promoting those ways of life for generations to come.";66;2240;2171;1843;2007.0
66;essay67.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/practice-attempt-creative-artists-28640/;Creative Artists;"Innovative artists bring enjoyment and inspiration to our sometimes tedious life; however, some people deem that artists have been entrusted with too much freedom and power and should be restricted by the government. It is my personal belief that freedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be eulogized and it's rather iniquitous to impose a shackle on artists' will to create.
 One of the major concerns against freeing artists' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society; however, I believe the audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work. It is needless to say that art inevitably involves imagination, exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not, it is the public's authority to determine how to interpret its meaning. If the art displays unreality, the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value; if the art reflects the reality, then what would be the intention to ban it if it was not for covering the dirty truth? Would it be autocratic if the government clamp down the artists who are telling the truth? In a word, the notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified.
 Let's then take a look at the impact that art has posed on individuals. It is undeniable that some of the art work may contain negative implications such as insanity, violence, eroticism etc. I absolutely agree that restrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply as adolescents are not mature enough to avoid being led astray by these contents; however, in the case of adults being the audience, there's really nothing to hide – these negative things objectively exist on this planet and it is impossible for adults to be brain-washed only because of some pieces of creative art.
 By way of conclusion, I do not root for the idea that restrictions should be put on artists work; on the contrary, they should be encouraged to express their innovative ideas – this world needs them to make itself colourful.
";"Creative artists are individuals who use their imagination and skills to create works of art. They are often considered to be the most creative people in society, and their work can be seen in many forms, from paintings and sculptures to music and literature. Creative artists have the ability to take an idea and turn it into something tangible that can be appreciated by others.
 
 Creative artists are often driven by a passion for their craft. They are constantly looking for new ways to express themselves and explore their creativity. They are often willing to take risks and push the boundaries of what is possible. They are also often willing to experiment with different mediums and techniques in order to create something unique and original.
 
 Creative artists are often inspired by the world around them. They may draw inspiration from nature, from other works of art, or from their own experiences. They often take elements from different sources and combine them in order to create something new and unique. This process of combining different elements is often referred to as mash-ups.
 
 Creative artists often have a strong sense of self-expression. They are often able to express their feelings and emotions through their work. This can be seen in the way they use color, texture, and composition to create a certain mood or atmosphere. Creative artists also often have a strong sense of personal style, which can be seen in the way they choose to present their work.
 
 Creative artists often have a deep understanding of the world around them. They are often able to see things from different perspectives and to think outside of the box. This allows them to come up with innovative solutions to problems and to create works of art that are both aesthetically pleasing and meaningful.
 
 Creative artists are often highly motivated and driven individuals. They are often willing to put in the time and effort required to create something truly unique and special. They are often willing to take risks and to push themselves in order to create something that is truly their own.
 
 Creative artists are an important part of our society. They are often the ones who are able to bring new ideas and perspectives to the table. They are often the ones who are able to create works of art that can be appreciated and enjoyed by others. They are often the ones who are able to inspire and motivate others to pursue their own creative endeavors.";"Creative artists come in many forms and from all walks of life. From painters, sculptors, dancers, sculptors, musicians, and performance artists to photographers, graphic designers, filmmakers, stylists, and more, creative artists push boundaries and express their perspectives in ways that are unique to them.
 
 Creative artists help to expand our understanding of our world and ourselves by communicating stories, feelings, and thoughts in ways that are often not easily expressed through words alone. By exploring the complexities of their craft, creative artists are able to express their inspirations, their emotions, and their experiences in a way that allows others to understand their point of view and connect with their art.
 
 Creative artists often take risks in their craft to expand the spectrum of what they are able to communicate to the masses. They explore and challenge the accepted norms of their craft in order to make something that is truly expressive and emotionally honest. Whether it be breaking down genres in music, reinterpreting the symbolism of dance moves, or pushing the boundaries of what is traditionally considered to be art, creative artists are continuously pushing themselves and their work forward in order to express their idiosyncrasies.
 
 Throughout history, creative artists have been the driving force in pushing boundaries and expressing themselves in a myriad of ways. From the old masters of the renaissance to the musical innovators of the 20th century, creative artists have shown us how powerful and unique their perspectives can be. Whether it be with a paintbrush, a microphone, a camera, or a computer, creative artists have the ability to shape the way we think and feel in a way that no other profession can.
 
 In conclusion, creative artists are an essential part of our society, as their unique perspectives, ideas, and skill sets allow them to express themselves in ways that can inspire and move the masses. They are continuously pushing the boundaries of the accepted norms and exploring new ways of communicating with their art. Therefore, it is clear that creative artists play a key role in our lives and in the progression of art as a whole.";16;2146;2458;2209;2333.5
67;essay68.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/should-goverment-control-media-crime-28414/;should goverment control media crime;"The soaring crime rate has led to the proposal that it is time for the government to take action to control the proliferation of violent scenes in media.
 Obviously, violence in the media is often portrayed as extreme as possible in order to attract audiences. This will definitely set a bad example for the immature audiences who, lacking correct parental guidance and abilities to differentiate the right from wrong, are prone to go astray by imitating the violent behaviours and committing real violent crimes as they regard the violence as reasonable and justifiable.
 On the other hand, media, such as TV or film, is considered as the correct information source regulated by the government. It should be reporting and reflecting true phenomenon in the society. Violence, as one of the facts in the real world, certainly has to be reported. However, excessive violence would offer misleading information to the public and exert detrimental influence to the society as well. It is recently reported in the news that a seventeen-year-old boy killed all his family members, one sister and two parents out of hatred and jealousy. In the real world, we are inclined to take extreme approach to tackle a small problem due to excessive violence exposure.
 We cannot deny that our society is occupied with the violent scenes and plots at present. What the government should do immediately is to strengthen censorship to control the amount of violence in media. Otherwise, the violent crime rate will rise continuously and out of control someday.
";"The media plays an important role in our society, providing us with news, entertainment, and education. It is also a powerful tool for influencing public opinion and shaping public discourse. As such, it is important to consider the role of government in regulating the media and its content.
 
 The primary purpose of government regulation of the media is to protect the public from harm. This includes protecting citizens from false or misleading information, as well as from content that could be considered offensive or inappropriate. Government regulation of the media can also help to ensure that the media is used responsibly and ethically.
 
 When it comes to crime, government regulation of the media can be beneficial in a number of ways. For example, it can help to discourage the glorification of criminal activity, which can lead to copycat crimes. It can also help to ensure that the media is not used to spread false information about crime, which can lead to public panic and confusion. Additionally, government regulation of the media can help to ensure that the media is used responsibly when reporting on crime, such as by avoiding sensationalism and providing accurate information.
 
 However, it is important to note that government regulation of the media can also have negative consequences. For example, it can lead to censorship and the suppression of free speech. Additionally, it can lead to the media being used as a tool of propaganda, which can be used to manipulate public opinion.
 
 Overall, government regulation of the media can be beneficial in terms of crime, but it is important to consider the potential negative consequences as well. It is also important to ensure that any regulation is done in a way that is consistent with the principles of free speech and democracy.";"Over the last few decades, the media has become an increasingly important part of our lives, shaping how we perceive the world and how we respond to events. With its widespread reach and powerful influence, the media can be a vital tool for disseminating information about crime and raising public awareness of criminal activity. The question then arises, should the government take a more active role in controlling the media's coverage of crime?
 
 On the one hand, it is important for the public to be aware of the dangers of criminal activity in their communities. This is especially true for crimes that threaten public safety, as knowing about these dangers can help people to take measures to protect themselves. Additionally, by having knowledge of what crimes are occurring in their area, citizens can feel empowered to take part in prevention efforts.
 
 On the other hand, the media can, at times, sensationalize crime stories, exaggerating the facts or distorting the truth in order to draw attention. This can lead to panic and fear, which can lead to people making uninformed decisions that can put themselves or others in danger. Additionally, the government may wish to control the medias coverage of certain sensitive topics, such as terrorism-related activities, in order to protect national security.
 
 Overall, the government does have a legitimate interest in controlling media crime coverage, as it can ensure that citizens are adequately informed yet not unduly alarmed. It can also take steps to prevent the media from sharing sensitive information that has the potential to be misused. However, care should be taken to ensure that government control does not trample on the medias right to freedom of expression. After all, providing information about crime to the public is a key part of the medias role in democratic societies.";36;1542;1810;1855;1832.5
68;essay69.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/nowadays-more-opportunities-women-than-past-28338/;Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past;"The modern times have witnessed profound changes in most aspects of life, including the revolution of feminism. Women have been opened up to more chances than ever. This, contrary to some ideas, is a positive progress in human society from my point of view.
 To start with, the fairness between males and females is inevitable in such a developed society. Gone are the days when women could do nothing rather than stick to boring house work and take care of children. Women nowadays are much more active, they may be successful businessmen, they join the political world, they become scientists and so on. This is to say, the ""weaker"" gender as often be thought has enough right as well as ability to contribute to the development of human beings just like any other men, not to mention they even perform better in some fields.
 In the second place, the revolution in females' right has brought about many benefits not only to themselves but society as well. The financial burden of families, for instance, has decreased significantly with both the wives and the husbands working to earn money. What is more, women have the outstanding instinct to take up some careers lie healthcare or human resource management due to their patience and elaboration.
 Admittedly, such changes do lead to some negative results like an upward trend in divorce rate or, under many circumstances, women find it difficult to balance their work and their traditional role as the wives. Also, children might enjoy less care from parents as they arre both busy with theit work. Yet everything has it upside and downside, women should find the best way to overcome such challenges.
 All things considered, in a society where females are given equal opportunities compared with males would obviously enjoy lots of benefits far outweighing its obstacles.
";"Nowadays, women have more opportunities than ever before. In the past, women were often relegated to traditional roles such as homemakers and mothers, with limited access to education and employment. However, in recent years, there has been a dramatic shift in the way women are viewed in society. Women are now seen as capable and independent individuals who can pursue their own dreams and ambitions.
 
 The most obvious example of this shift is the increased access to education and employment. In the past, women were often denied access to higher education and certain professions. Now, women have the same opportunities as men to pursue higher education and to enter the workforce. This has opened up a world of possibilities for women, allowing them to pursue their dreams and reach their full potential.
 
 In addition, there are now more opportunities for women to become leaders in their respective fields. Women are now seen as capable and competent leaders, and are increasingly being appointed to positions of power in both the public and private sectors. This has allowed women to take on roles of responsibility and influence, and to make a real difference in the world.
 
 Finally, there are now more opportunities for women to become financially independent. In the past, women were often dependent on their husbands or fathers for financial support. Now, women have the same access to financial resources as men, allowing them to become financially independent and to pursue their own goals.
 
 Overall, it is clear that there are now more opportunities for women than there were in the past. Women are now seen as capable and independent individuals who can pursue their own dreams and ambitions. This shift has opened up a world of possibilities for women, allowing them to pursue their dreams and reach their full potential.";"Nowadays, there are more opportunities for women than ever before. In the past, women had less rights and opportunities, either due to social norms or legal restrictions. Women were not able to participate in any sort of major decision-making, pursue higher education, or own property. Women were largely restricted to the home and were not given adequate representation in the workplace.
 
 Thankfully, things have changed. Over the past several decades, society has been making progress in widening access to opportunities for women. There have been huge strides in matters of education and employment, as well as in legal representation, political representation, and advancement of female rights. Increasingly, women are getting access to higher education, internships, and entry-level jobs that they never had before.
 
 Women now have access to a wide range of job and career opportunities. Many companies have begun to recognize the importance of having a diverse workforce and have made strides in promoting gender equality. This has opened up more opportunities for women to take on leadership roles and get into careers that had previously been predominantly male-dominated.
 
 In addition to opportunities in the workplace, there has been a shift in perceptions of womens roles in society. Women are increasingly being seen as strong and capable partners in relationships, both in the workplace and at home. This has presented more opportunities for women to achieve personal goals and to be recognized for their efforts.
 
 Finally, legal advancements have been made to protect women from discrimination and unfair treatment. Equal pay and anti-discrimination legislation, as well as laws protecting womens reproductive rights, have allowed women to take control of their lives and pursue their dreams without fear of being penalized or subjected to prejudice.
 
 To sum up, women today have more opportunities than ever before. Through legal, social, and economic advancement, women have been given a voice in society and access to a variety of opportunities that were not available to them in the past. As the world continues to move towards greater gender equality, the opportunities available to women will only continue to expand.";75;1829;1845;2247;2046.0
69;essay70.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/growing-traffic-pollution-controlled-increasing-petrol-28336/;Growing traffic & pollution can be controlled by increasing petrol prices;"As we read newspapers or watch TV, we have always been attracted by environmental problems such as traffic issues, air and water pollution questions. Initiatives should be taken to address the specific problems. As the impacts for those pollution and traffic issues are extremely far-reaching, it is insufficient to increase the petrol price only to solve problems, though it is a promising method discussed in the contemporary society.
 Specifically, price control institution has been used in plenty of social areas, for example, in the farming products and in the real estate area; however, whether it can work out for alleviating traffic and pollution pressure ought to be evaluated. On one hand, governments have a macro-economic perspective to control price in various areas according to social demands. Consequently, it seems not easy to increase petrol price instantly. On the other hand, pollutions are not just caused by the burning of oil, chemical pollutants, extra lights, also constitute considerable amount of pollution. In addition, the improvements of work efficiency also attribute to the speed-up of working pace, resulting in traffic jams during rush-hours.
 As illustrated before, several other solutions can be introduced to assist in reducing pollution and traffic problems. Primarily, authorities should spare no efforts in improving public transportation facilities, such as constructing more bus lines, in order to reducing the usage of private cars. Furthermore, temporarily targets should be set, with regard to the limitations of pollutants in a certain period of time, for example, a season. Plus with supervisory institutions built to find and address problems. Meanwhile, cultivating a sense of environmental protection would also work out, though it might not be into effect immediately, but in the long run, it would be a wise choice.
 In conclusion, addressing pollution and traffic issues only by increasing oil price Is not adequate, while improving transportation facilities and building supervisory institution would be preferable, plus with the awareness of environmental protection being raised.
";"The world is facing a growing problem of traffic and pollution, and it is becoming increasingly clear that something needs to be done to address this issue. One potential solution is to increase petrol prices, as this could help to reduce the amount of traffic on the roads and thus reduce the amount of pollution that is created.
 
 The first way that increasing petrol prices could help to reduce traffic and pollution is by making it more expensive for people to drive. This would mean that people would be less likely to use their cars for short journeys, and instead opt for public transport or other forms of transport. This would reduce the amount of traffic on the roads, and thus reduce the amount of pollution that is created.
 
 Another way that increasing petrol prices could help to reduce traffic and pollution is by encouraging people to buy more fuel-efficient cars. If petrol prices are higher, people will be more likely to invest in cars that are more fuel-efficient, as this will help them to save money in the long run. This would mean that fewer cars would be on the roads, and thus fewer emissions would be created.
 
 Finally, increasing petrol prices could also help to reduce traffic and pollution by encouraging people to use alternative forms of transport. If petrol prices are higher, people may be more likely to use public transport or other forms of transport such as cycling or walking. This would reduce the amount of traffic on the roads, and thus reduce the amount of pollution that is created.
 
 In conclusion, increasing petrol prices could be an effective way of reducing traffic and pollution. It would make it more expensive for people to drive, encourage people to buy more fuel-efficient cars, and encourage people to use alternative forms of transport. All of these measures would help to reduce the amount of traffic on the roads, and thus reduce the amount of pollution that is created.";"In an increasingly interconnected world, traffic and pollution have become an expansive problem in many cities across the world. The pollution and traffic caused by automobile use can have a devastating effect on the health of citizens, putting a strain on resources and development projects. The solution of increasing petrol prices could help to reduce traffic and pollution, however it raises a number of challenges that should be addressed.
 
 The rise in petrol prices would be beneficial in terms of curbing traffic and pollution. Drivers would be less likely to travel long distances and would be incentivised to use public transport or car pool. In addition, the increased costs of fuel would discourage the purchase of larger and more heavily polluting vehicles. Furthermore, the revenue made from the increase in petrol prices could be used to develop clean energy schemes, such as electric cars, buses and rail. This would have both a positive environmental and financial impact. 
 
 The implementation of higher petrol prices, however, requires careful consideration. Low income households would be hit the hardest, as their finances are usually less adaptable to sudden changes. Therefore, the increased costs of fuel would likely have a negative effect on the economy, as people would be discouraged from spending money on goods and services. Consequently, there is a need to find a balance between higher petrol prices and protecting those on low incomes.
 
 In conclusion, increasing petrol prices could be an effective way to reduce traffic and pollution levels. It would not only lower the number of journeys made by car, but also encourage the uptake of clean energy solutions. Nevertheless, further discussion is needed to ensure that low income households are not adversely affected by any changes. Only when this is ensured, can petrol prices be increased in cities to help combat traffic and pollution.";73;2137;1933;1925;1929.0
70;essay71.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/should-all-advertisements-banned-29250/;should all the advertisements be banned?;"Never in history was advertising industry so developed as in modern society and it has led to some adverse sentiments in public because some deliver exaggerated and fake information. Hence whether we should ban all the advertisements or not has aroused much controversy of the public. My view is that while some of them are disturbing, we can not overlook other merits the advertisements bring.
 First, it is unfair to restrict those public service advertisements which are creative and inspiring. In fact, they are not in the purpose of making profits but taking a role of disseminating valued culture, good moral traits and calling for helps for the disabled and the poor.
 Besides, it is obvious that publicizing brand image or a particular product of mass media could boost sales for companies. In a larger sense, it could simulate household spending and therefore promote the economic development of the whole country. A recent study shows that after launching an advertising campaign, the sales revenue would increase by 40%, which is the very fact to verify its positive influences on economic.
 That is not to say, however, that advertisements have no downsides. Of course, the advertising expenses lead to a higher product price and some of them express fake information, creating information asymmetry between consumers and companies. Yet, its merits still outweigh these downsides.
 Taken all together, advertisements have its social responsibility and contribute to economic growth. We can not deny all of them. However, if those with exaggerated and fake information could be banned, advertisements would be welcomed by more.
";"The debate over whether all advertisements should be banned has been a contentious one for many years. On one hand, some people argue that advertisements are necessary for businesses to promote their products and services, while on the other hand, others believe that advertisements are intrusive and should be banned. This essay will explore both sides of the argument and ultimately conclude that advertisements should not be banned, but instead should be regulated to ensure that they are not intrusive or misleading.
 
 To begin with, it is important to recognize that advertisements are an essential part of the modern economy. Without them, businesses would not be able to reach their target audiences and promote their products and services. Furthermore, advertisements can be a powerful tool for informing consumers about new products and services, and can even help to create competition in the marketplace, which can lead to lower prices and better quality products. Therefore, it is clear that advertisements are an important part of the economy and should not be banned.
 
 However, it is also important to recognize that advertisements can be intrusive and misleading. For example, some advertisements may be designed to manipulate consumers into buying products that they do not need or cannot afford. Additionally, some advertisements may be targeted at vulnerable populations, such as children, and can be used to exploit their naivety. Therefore, it is clear that advertisements should be regulated to ensure that they are not intrusive or misleading.
 
 In conclusion, it is clear that advertisements are an important part of the economy and should not be banned. However, it is also important to recognize that advertisements can be intrusive and misleading, and should therefore be regulated to ensure that they are not. Ultimately, it is up to governments and other regulatory bodies to ensure that advertisements are not intrusive or misleading, and that they are used responsibly.";"The ubiquity of advertising in todays society is undeniable. From billboards to television ads, it is almost impossible to escape advertising in all its forms. This has sparked an intense debate on whether all advertisements should be banned. On one side, advocates of a ban cite social, economic, and ethical concerns as primary reasons for its necessity. On the other side, proponents of advertising argue that it is an integral and beneficial part of the marketplace. This essay will explore both sides of the issue in order to reach a conclusion.
 
 Advocates of a ban on all advertising point to social ills as the primary motivation for the proposed ban. They argue that advertisements pressure consumers to buy products that are unnecessary for their well-being, and that this is contributing to the widening gap between the wealthy and poor. Additionally, they contend that advertisements can be damaging to a persons self-esteem and can even lead to obsessive behaviors such as compulsive shopping. They also claim that advertising has a dehumanizing effect on society, as it depends on exploiting peoples emotions and insecurities in order to be successful.
 
 Opponents of a ban on all advertisements cite economic benefits as their primary argument. They argue that advertising is needed to maintain a competitive marketplace in which consumers can choose their preferred product or service. They maintain that businesses use advertising to inform consumers of new products that may improve their standard of living. Furthermore, they argue that advertisements provide jobs to many people in the creative industry, and are a source of revenue for many businesses.
 
 The debate surrounding whether or not all advertisements should be banned is complicated. On one hand, advocates of a ban cite social and ethical concerns as primary reasons for their position. On the other hand, those in favor of advertising cite its economic benefits. Ultimately, it appears that the issue is not a matter of banning all advertisements, but rather a matter of regulating and controlling the types of advertisements that are displayed. Thus, it may be more effective to regulate advertisements than to ban them entirely.";40;1639;2003;2217;2110.0
71;essay72.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/use-drugs-should-automatically-sentenced-time-prison-29213/;Those who use drugs should be automatically sentenced to time in prison;"Today, we no longer fear any contagious diseases, kudos to modern technology and medical advancement. However, it is the contagious behaviors such as addiction and the wrong abuse of drugs that continue to terrorize our society, especially the young ones. It is undeniable that drug addiction is indeed on the rise and effective solutions must be taken in order to trim down the number of drug addicts. Some suggest that it would be better if those caught red-handed using drugs be imprisoned. In my opinion, I disagree to the aforementioned resolution due to the reasons that I will put forward below.
 First of all, I do agree that some of the addicts do turn over a new leaf at the prison. Nevertheless, once they return to the society, they tend to relapse and get involved in drugs again. This is because, in the prisons, there would not be any programs or talks that can enlighten and transform them as well as change their perspectives towards drugs. As such, all the efforts of putting them behind bars are simply in vain. Instead, if the addicts are sent to rehabilitation centres, they will treated for their addiction. On top of that, counselors can provide them with counseling and motivation to help them build a new life.
 On the other hand, some argue that if the drug addicts are not given intense punishment, they will not change and continue to misuse drugs. Nonetheless, I believe that this is mainly due to the society not accepting the prisoners as a part of them. If only the society or the people surrounding the addicts give them a second chance, I am sure that they will never abuse drugs once more. The support alone is not sufficient. They can also report to the concerned parties about any misuse of drugs at the residential areas. Thus, with more public awareness, drug abuse can be certainly be reduced and eventually brought to a halt without having to put the addicts into jail.
 Everyone of us deserves a second chance in life. After all, we are human beings and we learn from our mistakes. Referring to the consequentalist theory, the society should allow leniency for people to experiment and learn, as long as it is on their own expenses. To put it in a nutshell, I believe that sending the drug addicts to rehabilitation centres acts as a beacon of hope for the affected individuals and is also a crucial step in helping them redeem their lives and rejuvenate their lost hopes for a better future rather than sending them to prison.
";"Drug use is a serious problem in many countries around the world. It is a major cause of crime, violence, and poverty, and it can have a devastating effect on individuals and their families. For this reason, it is important that those who use drugs are held accountable for their actions. One way to do this is to impose automatic sentences of time in prison for those who are caught using drugs.
 
 The primary argument in favor of automatic sentences of time in prison for those who use drugs is that it serves as a deterrent. By imposing a harsh punishment for drug use, it sends a clear message that drug use will not be tolerated and that there are serious consequences for breaking the law. This can help to reduce the number of people who choose to use drugs, as they will be aware of the potential consequences of their actions.
 
 In addition, automatic sentences of time in prison for those who use drugs can help to reduce the amount of drug-related crime in a community. By removing those who are using drugs from the streets, it can help to reduce the amount of drug-related violence and other criminal activities. This can help to make communities safer and more secure.
 
 Finally, automatic sentences of time in prison for those who use drugs can help to reduce the amount of money spent on drug-related crime. By removing those who are using drugs from the streets, it can help to reduce the amount of money spent on law enforcement and other criminal justice costs. This can help to free up resources that can be used to fund other important public services.
 
 In conclusion, automatic sentences of time in prison for those who use drugs can be an effective way to reduce drug use, drug-related crime, and the amount of money spent on criminal justice costs. It can also help to make communities safer and more secure. For these reasons, it is important that those who use drugs are held accountable for their actions and that they face the consequences of their actions.";"The use of drugs is a controversial topic, but one thing is certain: those who use drugs should be subject to punishment. The use of drugs can have a devastating effect on individuals, families and communities, and the prevalence of drug use has contributed to many social and economic issues. Those who use drugs need to be held accountable, and an automatic sentence of time in prison can be an effective way to discourage drug use.
 
 First, those who use drugs should be automatically sentenced to time in prison because it sends a clear and powerful message that drug use is not tolerated. A sentence of time in prison will also demonstrate that consequences for violating the law are real and can have serious repercussions. This could deter others from using drugs in the future and thus help reduce the number of people addicted to drugs.
 
 Second, this type of punishment may also provide an opportunity for those who use drugs to seek help. While in prison, those who use drugs can benefit from addiction counseling, rehabilitation and other treatment services. These services can be a valuable resource in helping drug users overcome their addiction and become productive members of society.
 
 Finally, automatic sentences of time in prison can help protect the public from the dangers of drug use. By incarcerating drug users, they can no longer pose a threat to public safety. This can help reduce the amount of crime and violence associated with drug use and make communities safer.
 
 In conclusion, those who use drugs should be automatically sentenced to time in prison. This type of punishment will send a powerful message that drug use is not tolerated, will give those who use drugs an opportunity to seek help, and will help protect the public from the dangers of drug use.";71;2470;1990;1796;1893.0
72;essay73.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/image-more-powerful-than-written-word-29178/;Is image more powerful than the written word?;"""A picture is worth a thousand words"" is a popular maxim that is being used for a very long time. This strongly depicts the power of images in conveying messages, ideas, or opinions to people. Nevertheless, the importance of written word can never be denied as it is also another way of communication that is commonly used. Hence, I agree only to certain degree that in today's world, image serves as a more effective means of communication.
 Firstly, pictures can influence the way people think. For example, nowadays horrendous images are displayed on the cigarette boxes to illustrate the consequences of smoking. As a result, statistics show a slight reduction in the number of smokers, indicating that they realize the effects of the negative habit. Not only that, the magnificent photograph captured by Kevin Carter, which portrayed a starving Sudanese child struck by extreme poverty has successfully highlighted the plight faced by the citizens in Sudan. Apart from that, images are also widely used in newspapers, magazines and advertisements. Thus, it is undeniable that images in the absence of words can obviously claim the attraction of many.
 Looking from another perspective, written words are also vital in order to spread across certain messages. With only pictures, everyone is left to their own interpretation on how they perceive the images. Nonetheless, this is different when words are used to explain what the illustration is about. Furthermore, the primary way of educating students is also by this way. Academic textbooks these days are laden with words besides pictures to guide the readers to comprehend better.
 To conclude, both images and words go hand in hand and one cannot wholly emphasise on only one aspect, either images or words. Hence, for a more meaningful communication, these two elements have their respective roles to play: image to exemplify and words to describe a particular subject.
";"The debate of whether image or the written word is more powerful has been ongoing for centuries. While both have their merits, it is undeniable that image is more powerful than the written word.
 
 Image has the power to evoke emotion and create a lasting impression on the viewer. It can be used to convey a message without the need for words. A single image can tell a story, evoke a feeling, and create a lasting impression. It can be used to create a powerful and lasting impact on the viewer.
 
 The written word, on the other hand, is limited in its ability to evoke emotion and create a lasting impression. While words can be used to convey a message, they are often limited in their ability to create an emotional response. Words can be used to explain a concept or idea, but they are often limited in their ability to create a lasting impression.
 
 Image has the power to create a lasting impression and evoke emotion in a way that words cannot. Images can be used to create a powerful and lasting impact on the viewer. They can be used to convey a message without the need for words. Images can be used to create a powerful and lasting impression on the viewer.
 
 In conclusion, it is clear that image is more powerful than the written word. Images can be used to create a powerful and lasting impression on the viewer. They can be used to evoke emotion and create a lasting impression. Words can be used to explain a concept or idea, but they are often limited in their ability to create a lasting impression. Image has the power to create a lasting impression and evoke emotion in a way that words cannot.";"The written word is often seen as more powerful than images, as it has a greater ability to capture and convey detailed information. However, in todays image-driven world, it can be argued that image is indeed more powerful than the written word.
 
 Firstly, images can convey complex ideas in a much more effective way than words can. They can evoke strong emotions and draw people in quickly. In todays society, we are constantly bombarded with images, in the form of advertisements, social media posts, and the internet, and these visual cues have a deep effect on how we perceive the world. For example, a newspaper article about global warming may not have the same impact on a reader as an image of melting glaciers or a polar bear stranded on a shrinking iceberg.
 
 Secondly, images can often simplify complex ideas in a way that words cannot. Images compressed with text can help further contextualize information and hone a message. Visuals are also easier to recall than words. This is especially pertinent for marketing campaigns, where an effective visual can help create an association with a product or brand more easily than a written message can.
 
 Finally, images can reach a wider audience than the written word. Images are easier to understand than language, and can help people from all walks of life connect with a message. Images can be more effective in getting people to act: for example, a photos of a protest can be more compelling to a potential supporter than reading a manifesto.
 
 In conclusion, although the written word has traditionally been viewed as more powerful than images, in todays image-oriented world, image is arguably more powerful than the written word. It can convey complex ideas, simplify complex ideas, and reach a wider audience than the written word.";45;1930;1619;1804;1711.5
73;essay74.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/several-languages-danger-extinction-29112/;Several languages are in danger of extinction;"It is certainly true that some languages are disappearing day by day over the world. Some people, therefore, harbour a view saying that governments should preserve those by spending some budgets on them. But the others do not believe it is possible. In my opinion, this viewpoint needs to be examined thoroughly and this essay will discuss this issue.
 First and foremost, it is easy to realize that languages, especially oral language, are a quite major part of culture of a country. It helps people distinguish between nations and even regions in a country. The clearance of minority of language means that a national traditional, customs and habitants do not exist. Governments should spend money on keeping and preserving these things for the rich diversity of cultures which make our world more interesting. What is more, it is a pride of the country with a rage of culture which is easy to educate people to love their country more.
 On the other hand, there are some drawbacks from saving minority languages. Although governments invest money on doing that, it is hard to gain the good results. As evidence of this, there are a few people, particularly the youngsters, do not pay attention on collecting and studying those. These kinds of languages are usually difficult and unpopular. In addition, the preservations need a long time to gather, restore all information as well as train in the educational centre. If they do not try their best, their protection can be halted and waste of money.
 In a nutshell, I am convinced that all languages should be preserved and developed as much as possible. All people should give a hand to do this better and governments play a vital role on encouraging and distributing those.
";"In recent years, the world has seen a dramatic increase in the number of languages that are in danger of extinction. With the rise of globalization and the spread of English as a global language, many of the worlds smaller languages are being pushed to the brink of extinction. This is a major problem, as the loss of these languages would mean the loss of a unique cultural heritage and a valuable source of knowledge.
 
 The reasons for the decline of these languages are varied. In some cases, the language is simply not spoken by enough people to remain viable. In other cases, the language is being actively suppressed by governments or other powerful forces. For example, in some countries, the use of minority languages is discouraged or even prohibited in schools and other public places. This has the effect of making it difficult for speakers of these languages to pass them on to the next generation.
 
 In addition, the spread of English has had a major impact on the decline of many languages. As English becomes more widely spoken, it often replaces the native language of a particular region. This is especially true in areas where English is used as a lingua franca, such as in business or international relations. As a result, many native languages are becoming less and less used, and eventually, they may become extinct.
 
 The loss of these languages would be a tragedy. Each language is a unique expression of a culture, and the loss of a language would mean the loss of a valuable source of knowledge and understanding. In addition, the loss of a language would mean the loss of a unique way of looking at the world. For example, some languages have words that have no direct translation into English, and the loss of these words would mean the loss of a unique way of thinking about certain concepts.
 
 Fortunately, there are steps that can be taken to help preserve these languages. Governments and other organizations can work to promote the use of minority languages in schools and other public places. In addition, linguists and other experts can work to document and preserve these languages, so that they can be passed on to future generations.
 
 In conclusion, the world is facing a major problem in the form of the extinction of many languages. This is a tragedy, as the loss of these languages would mean the loss of a unique cultural heritage and a valuable source of knowledge. Fortunately, there are steps that can be taken to help preserve these languages, and it is important that we take action to ensure that these languages are not lost forever.";"Language is a part of a culture that is passed down through generations. It is the bridge between people of different backgrounds, it is the way that people communicate, and it is the way that cultures have been preserved and shared for centuries. Unfortunately, several languages are in danger of extinction. This is a cause for concern because language extinction leads to the erosion of cultural identity and knowledge. 
 
 Language extinction occurs when a language is no longer spoken or used and is replaced by another language. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as when a language is no longer taught in schools, when people move from a place and take the language with them, when a language is replaced by a more desirable language, or when a language is not passed down in the home because parents want their children to learn the language of the dominant culture. 
 
 Language extinction has worrying implications. It can lead to the loss of a cultures collective memory, traditions, and values, as well as important knowledge that can only be shared via the language. For example, endangered languages can contain words that are used to describe plants and animals that are vital to a peoples way of life. Without the language, this knowledge is lost forever. 
 
 In recent years, there has been a push to try to revive endangered languages. Governments, indigenous communities, and individuals are recognizing the importance of these languages and are working to preserve them for future generations. This includes creating campaigns to raise awareness, providing funding to encourage people to learn and use the language, teaching the language in schools, and providing people with resources to learn and practice the language. 
 
 Despite these efforts, the continuing decline of endangered languages needs to be addressed. It is important to recognize the value of languages and to be aware of the consequences of language extinction. We must act to preserve these languages for ourselves and for future generations.";45;1728;2587;2044;2315.5
74;essay75.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/do-arts-music-improve-quality-life-29000/;Do arts and music improve the quality of life?;"My view is that the government should give priorities to invest more money on the basic social welfares such as education and housing instead of subsidizing arts relative programs.
 Art is not the key determination of quality of life, but education is. In order to make people better off, it is more urgent for governments to commit money to some fundamental help such as setting more scholarships in education section for all citizens. This is simply because knowledge and wisdom is the guarantee of the enhancement of the quality of people's lives for a well-rounded social system.
 Admittedly, art, to some extent, serve a valuable function about enriching one's daily lives, for example, it could bring release one's heavy burden of study pressure and refresh human bodies through a hard day from work. However, it is unrealistic to pursuit of this high standard of life in many developing countries, in which the basic housing supply has still been a huge problem with plenty of lower income family have squeezed in a small tight room. By comparison to these issues, the pursuit of art seems unimportant at all.
 To conclude, art could play an active role in improving the quality of people's lives, but I think that governments should attach heavier weight to other social issues such as education and housing needs because those are the most essential ways enable to make people a decent life.
";"The arts and music have been a part of human life since the dawn of civilization. From the earliest cave paintings to the most modern forms of expression, art and music have been used to express emotion, tell stories, and create beauty. In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of the arts and music in improving the quality of life.
 
 The arts and music can have a positive impact on mental and physical health. Studies have shown that engaging in creative activities such as painting, drawing, and playing music can reduce stress and anxiety, improve mood, and increase self-esteem. Music has also been found to have a calming effect on the body, reducing heart rate and blood pressure. Furthermore, the arts and music can provide an outlet for self-expression and can help to foster a sense of community.
 
 The arts and music can also have a positive impact on education. Studies have shown that students who are exposed to the arts and music have higher academic achievement and better problem-solving skills. Additionally, the arts and music can help to foster creativity, critical thinking, and collaboration. These skills are essential for success in the modern world.
 
 Finally, the arts and music can have a positive impact on the economy. The arts and music can create jobs and generate revenue for local businesses. Furthermore, the arts and music can attract tourists to an area, which can help to boost the local economy.
 
 In conclusion, the arts and music can have a positive impact on the quality of life. They can improve mental and physical health, foster creativity and critical thinking, and help to boost the local economy. Therefore, it is important to recognize the importance of the arts and music and to ensure that they are supported and encouraged.";"Do arts and music improve the quality of life?
 
 The answer to this question is an emphatic yes. From the beginning of time, art and music have been essential components of daily life. They can increase our sense of well-being, have a positive impact on our health, and help us to express ourselves in creative and meaningful ways.
 
 First of all, the beauty of art and music can be uplifting and inspiring. Just looking at artwork or listening to a piece of music can stimulate our senses and evoke powerful emotions. This can lift our spirits and make us feel more connected to ourselves, to others, and to the world around us. In addition, studies have shown that engaging in art and music can help to reduce stress and improve our overall mental health.
 
 Furthermore, art and music can help us to express ourselves and process our experiences. Through painting, drawing, writing, and playing music, we can find purpose and meaning in life. Art and music can also help us to communicate with others and to form close relationships. By sharing our creative pursuits, we can create stronger bonds with family, friends, and even strangers.

It allows us to explore our imaginations and to connect with our deepest selves. In this way, art and music can be a valuable form of self-expression and a source of joy in life.
 
 In conclusion, art and music play an essential role in improving the quality of life. They have the power to inspire, to heal, and to bring us closer to ourselves and to others. It is our responsibility to appreciate and nurture these creative pursuits, and to embrace them as an essential part of life.";46;1401;1810;1811;1810.5
75;essay76.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/government-should-responsible-education-health-care-not-28777/;Government should be responsible for education and health care or not?;"Despite the development of modern society, the health care and education still remain the basic rights of citizens. And a much debated issue these days is whether or not the government should be responsible for citizens' health care and education.
 Some people argue that it is the government that should be obligated to fund the health care and education for citizens. This is because citizens enjoy the right to live in a harmonious and stable environment, which should be enabled by the government, the leader of the society. If citizens had no access to health care and education, their physical health and psychological soundness would be at risk. As a result, such people might fail to get cured in time, thus influencing their working efficiency, which would destabilize the production of the industry. Also, without sufficient guidance of teachers, these citizens might misbehave or even commit crimes, posing a threat to other citizens' security. Therefore, the government should be accountable for citizens' health care and education to keep society safe and stable.
 On the other hand, some people oppose the argument, saying it is a waste of public money for the government to subsidize health care and education of each citizen in society, since a great number of people, in fact, have had the capacity to pay for the both privately. Instead, the government should give priority to more pressing problems related to social members' wellbeing, such as soaring crime rate, AIDS epidemic or the shortage of infrastructure, which are requiring financial resources from the government to address.
 Personally, I think the government should fund the deprived for their health care and education, who are the group in real need for the authority's help. At the same time, citizens available for the both should encourage the government to allocate money to more urgent areas. After all, the harmonious society calls for the joint efforts of the government and citizens.
";"The debate over whether or not the government should be responsible for providing education and health care is an ongoing one. On one hand, some argue that the government should be responsible for providing these services as they are essential for the well-being of citizens and are necessary for a functioning society. On the other hand, some argue that the government should not be responsible for providing these services as it would be too costly and would take away from other important government services.
 
 The argument for the government providing education and health care is that these services are essential for the well-being of citizens and are necessary for a functioning society. Education is essential for the development of a persons skills and knowledge, which are necessary for them to be able to participate in the economy and contribute to society. Health care is also essential for the well-being of citizens and is necessary for them to be able to lead healthy and productive lives. Therefore, providing these services is necessary for the functioning of society and should be the responsibility of the government.
 
 On the other hand, the argument against the government providing these services is that it would be too costly and would take away from other important government services. Providing education and health care is expensive and would require a large amount of money that could be used for other important services such as infrastructure, defense, and social services. Additionally, providing these services could lead to a decrease in the quality of other government services as the government would have to spread its resources more thinly.
 
 In conclusion, the debate over whether or not the government should be responsible for providing education and health care is an ongoing one. While there are arguments for and against the government providing these services, it is ultimately up to the government to decide what is best for its citizens.";"The debate surrounding the role of government in providing education and healthcare services is an ongoing one and it is apparent that there is no unanimous opinion. The proponents of the argument that government should be responsible for both these fields insist that they are basic human rights that should be universally accessible and that it is the responsibility of the government to ensure this occurs. Conversely, those who disagree with this view hold the belief that providing these services should be the role of the private sector or even voluntary organizations.
 
 On one hand, there are a multitude of reasons why a government should, indeed, provide education and healthcare. Firstly, a public education system would mean that everyone could access the same level of education, regardless of their socio-economic background, thus preventing the widening of inequality. Furthermore, it would encourage a pursuit of knowledge and skill-development which would, in turn, boost employment opportunities and economic growth. Government-funded healthcare, on the other hand, would ensure that all citizens have access to the same level of healthcare, removing the discrepancies that stem from financial disparities. It would, further, eliminate the fear of being unable to pay for medical expenses, allowing individuals to focus on their physical and emotional health, rather than the cost.
 
 On the other hand, those who oppose the notion that government should be responsible for education and healthcare believe that the private sector or voluntary organizations should provide these services and that the government should instead focus on regulating and administering them, to ensure their efficiency. Private institutions, for example, could tailor their education systems to the specific needs and interests of students, and voluntary organizations could provide healthcare to those who are unable to bear the cost. Moreover, such institutions could potentially provide better resources due to the greater access to funds than a public system.
 
 In conclusion, there is no one answer to the question of whether government should be responsible for providing education and healthcare. While both sides of the debate put forward reasonable arguments, ultimately it is up to the leaders of a nation to decide the most suitable approach and enact appropriately.";70;1976;1989;2376;2182.5
76;essay77.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/protect-animals-zoos-should-banned-29767/;zoos should be banned;"Children tend to visit zoos where various kinds of wild creatures could be seen. When it comes to whether zoos should exist on contemporary society, animal-right activists strongly recommended that wildlife belong to natural environment and zoos should be banned. I would not go along with their viewpoint as zoos have irreplaceable benefits in terms of animal preservation and children education.
 There is no denying that our environment is damaged day by day due to the fact that excessive pursuit of economic development at expense of eco-system, which pose a great threat to the survival of wild animals. In contrast, zoo is a good alternative choice for protecting animals as various animals could be better protected by specialized staff. Once the animal got sick, professional vet will help them promptly. Thanks to the considerate care, the diversity of wild animal could be guaranteed.
 Additionally, zoos afford a platform to education teenagers, helping to establish eco-friendly behavior towards animals. In the zoos, even though wild animals are caged, they have capability to walk in a limited area. When children pay a visit to the zoos, they still could observe the eating behavior or leisure activities among animals, which would definitely enrich their knowledge associated with different animals. Further, children could acquire the information regarding how to protect wild animals according to guided tour or volunteers.
 On the other hand, complained about the drawbacks of zoos are often heard. It is true that some zoos are lack of systematic management which attributes to numerous wild animals die because of food shortage. Also, being caged in the zoos for long render wildlife lost the ability to survive in nature where is full of cruel competition among various animals.
 In order to protect animals, from my perspective, zoos offer a good man-made environment which could prolong the life span of wild animals and cultivate the notion of protecting animals. What the zoos should do is improvement of the management system and use the income wisely in preserving wild animals better.
";"Zoos have been a part of our society for centuries, and while they have been a source of entertainment and education for many, there is a growing sentiment that they should be banned. This essay will explore the reasons why zoos should be banned, and why they are no longer a viable option for animal conservation.
 
 First, zoos are not a suitable environment for animals. Animals in zoos are often kept in cramped, unnatural enclosures, and are deprived of the freedom to roam and explore their natural habitats. This can lead to physical and psychological distress, as well as a decrease in their overall health. Furthermore, animals in zoos are often subjected to cruel and inhumane treatment, such as being forced to perform in shows or being subjected to medical experiments. This is not only unethical, but it is also a violation of the animals rights.
 
 Second, zoos are not an effective way to conserve endangered species. While zoos may be able to provide a safe haven for some species, they are not able to provide the necessary resources for the species to thrive. Furthermore, the animals in zoos are often bred in captivity, which can lead to inbreeding and a decrease in genetic diversity. This can have a negative impact on the species ability to survive in the wild.
 
 Finally, zoos are not a sustainable option for animal conservation. Zoos require a large amount of resources, such as food, water, and energy, which can be better used to protect and conserve wild habitats. Furthermore, zoos are expensive to maintain, and the money spent on them could be better used to fund conservation efforts in the wild.
 
 In conclusion, zoos should be banned. They are not a suitable environment for animals, they are not an effective way to conserve endangered species, and they are not a sustainable option for animal conservation. It is time for us to move away from zoos and focus our efforts on protecting and conserving wild habitats.";"In recent years, the debate over the ethical implications of animal captivity in zoos has resurfaced with strong opinions on both sides of the argument. Supporters of zoos argue that they are beneficial in animal conservation and education. However, there is a very strong case to be made against keeping wild animals in captivity. This essay will argue that, based on the physical and psychological harms posed to animals in captivity as well as the lack of genuine conservation and education efforts, zoos should be banned.
 
 First, keeping wild animals in captivity is incredibly damaging for their physical health. Animals in captivity often suffer from stress and depression, often resulting in various forms of self-mutilation such as rocking, head bobbing, and even tail biting. Additionally, animals in zoos are restricted in the amount of natural movement they can make, which can lead to problems with joint and muscle development. This can cause long-term health issues as well as a shortened lifespan for the animals. Furthermore, zoos often lack in providing for the proper nutrition and healthcare for their captive animals and many have died due to medical neglect. All of these physical health issues could be avoided if animals were left in their natural habitats, where they could exercise, feed and hunt naturally.
 
 Second, captivity can also have lasting psychological effects on the animals of zoos. Wild animals in captivity can become bored and frustrated, leading to abnormal behaviors that they would not display in the wild. Furthermore, animals can become overly dependent on humans, leading to anxiety and fear when interacting with humans and other animals. These physiological changes can have irreversible implications, ultimately leading to a decrease in fitness and reproductive success, which can have devastating consequences on the health of wild animal populations.
 
 Lastly, keeping wild animals in captivity does not provide the education or conservation efforts that it claims to. Zoos often focus on providing entertainment for visitors rather than educating on the dangers of human actions on wildlife or the need for conservation efforts, meaning that these zoos are not doing the work they claim to be doing. Furthermore, the conservation efforts of zoos are questionable at best. Breeding programs for endangered species can be incredibly costly and in some cases, can actually lead to the animals decline rather than their preservation.
 
 In conclusion, zoos should be banned due to the physical and psychological strikes posed to animals in captivity, as well as the lack of education and conservation efforts provided by them. Keeping wild animals in captivity can cause long-term health issues, psychological effects, and can be detrimental to the conservation of endangered species.";21;2115;1952;2837;2394.5
77;essay78.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/economic-development-vs-environment-29747/;economic development vs environment;"Currently, a great number of countries have pushed forward their economies by developing national industries. However, some people are worried that the economic targets in industrialized countries may be attained at the expense of the ecosystems. From my perspective, I think flourishing economies can go hand in hand with environmental preservation.
 Admittedly, some countries may place economic developments ahead of environmental protection, thus ruining the local environments. As these needy countries lack adequate financial and human resources, advanced technologies and experience, they have to rely on natural resources to maintain their living standards. Besides, people in the poverty-stricken areas are not likely to be equipped with knowledge to preserve the ecosystems. As a result, unchecked and reckless uses of the local raw materials may happen, which can put a strain on the natural resources. In this view, the economic development and environmental protection can be conflicting.
 However, I believe the booming economy can be closely linked to the preservation of the environment. With people raising their awareness of the green economy, the products free of pollutants are increasingly prevalent among clients, which means eco-friendly businesses can make a favourable impression on customers today, triggering sales. For example, electronic bicycles powered by clean energy resources have been well received among people in recent years.
 Furthermore, taking environmental consequences seriously can enhance working efficiencies. If a firm is environmentally conscious, it may have to make optimal use of its resources to improve its production lines and equipment, which can boost productivity. Therefore, it may spur its economic development. On the other hand, without the requirement of environmental preservation, the firm would still consume a vast amount of energy which constitutes a large part of its operational costs, being a hurdle to the economic develpment.
 Therefore, I would conclude that thriving economies and the preservation of ecosystems can be promoted simultaneously. On the other hand, I suppose the developed countries should support the underdeveloped areas by providing financial resources, technologies and experience so that the environmental problems can be effectively alleviated in these areas.
";"The debate between economic development and environmental protection has been a long-standing one. On one hand, economic development is essential for the growth and prosperity of a nation, while on the other hand, environmental protection is necessary to ensure the sustainability of the planet. This essay will discuss the importance of both economic development and environmental protection, and how they can be balanced to ensure a healthy and prosperous future.
 
 Economic development is essential for a nations growth and prosperity. It involves the use of resources to create goods and services that can be sold in the market. This generates income for the nation, which can be used to improve the quality of life of its citizens. Economic development also creates jobs and increases the standard of living. It also helps to reduce poverty and inequality, and can lead to greater economic stability.
 
 However, economic development can have a negative impact on the environment. The use of resources to create goods and services can lead to pollution, deforestation, and other environmental degradation. This can have a long-term impact on the planet, leading to climate change, loss of biodiversity, and other environmental issues.
 
 Environmental protection is essential to ensure the sustainability of the planet. It involves the use of resources in a way that does not harm the environment. This includes reducing pollution, conserving energy, and protecting natural habitats. It also involves the use of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, to reduce the use of fossil fuels.
 
 The balance between economic development and environmental protection is essential for a healthy and prosperous future. Economic development should be done in a way that does not harm the environment, and environmental protection should be done in a way that does not hinder economic growth. This can be achieved through the use of sustainable development strategies, such as green technology, renewable energy sources, and eco-friendly practices.
 
 In conclusion, economic development and environmental protection are both essential for a healthy and prosperous future. They should be balanced in order to ensure a sustainable future for the planet. This can be achieved through the use of sustainable development strategies, such as green technology, renewable energy sources, and eco-friendly practices.";"The debate over economic development versus environment is one that has existed for many years. Some emphasize that economic growth is vital to improving quality of life, while others emphasize that unchecked economic growth can have a detrimental effect on the environment and human health. In the end, the balance that needs to be struck is a difficult one, as it is a matter of weighing the costs and benefits of economic development against those of environmental protection.
 
 Economic development refers to the use of resources  both natural and human  to improve the productivity and overall standard of living in a region, usually for the long-term. This can take the form of improving infrastructure, providing access to basic services such as healthcare and education, or creating jobs and investment opportunities. 
 
 Environmental protection, on the other hand, refers to the preservation and conservation of the natural environment. This includes protecting biodiversity, controlling pollution and natural resource depletion, preventing climate change, and reducing other threats to ecosystems.
 
 The debate over economic growth versus environmental protection often arises in developing countries. For these countries, the focus is on improving their quality of life and reducing poverty. However, they must also contend with environmental issues such as air and water pollution, deforestation, and resource depletion. This creates a dilemma  if too little is done to address environmental issues, then the quality of life in the country will not improve. On the other hand, if too much is done to protect the environment, the country will not be able to develop economically.
 
 Ultimately, finding the right balance between economic growth and environmental protection is essential. Economic development is crucial for creating jobs and improving quality of life. At the same time, environmental protection is vital for preserving resources and preventing climate change. To strike the right balance, governments and businesses must take a holistic approach that considers not just the economic costs and benefits, but also the environmental and social costs and benefits. This will ensure that economic growth is sustainable and beneficial for both the environment and society.";35;2354;2419;2297;2358.0
78;essay79.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/government-should-spend-money-arts-not-only-public-services-29746/;Government should spend money on ARTs, not only on public services;"As people have raised their democratic awareness in recent years, they are caring more about how the tax expenditure is distributed by the government. As a result, some people suggest that the tax money should be allocated to publically beneficial services instead of arts. However, from my perspective, I think arts are supposed to be included in the government's investment as well.
 Admittedly, the government should give priority to public services and facilities. This is because the government plays the role of a leader among citizens, which should discharge the responsibility of making optimal use of the tax money to keep society safe and stable. Simultaneously, public services such as education system or medical care can meet people's basic demand of survival, security and knowledge, thus making them feel comfortable, which can lower the crime rate. Therefore, public services and facilities should be given adequate attention by the authorities to maintain social stability.
 On the other hand, I believe arts should by no means been disregarded by the government. Individually, arts can enrich people's cultural lives. Currently, people are increasingly occupied with their work and studies due to the stiff competition. Consequently, they require various entertainment such as music, movies or books to them ease their minds and release pressure. Without arts, people would be at risk of suffering psychological problems.
 From the point of the local community, funding arts is beneficial to the local cultural and economic development. Cultural heritage constitutes an essential part of arts. This means preserving local arts may promote the preservation of the local cultural heritage, which not only helps the local people have a sense of belonging but also contributes to the booming local tourism industry. In this view, arts serve cultural and economic purposes .
 With those arguments in mind, I would conclude that public services and facilities are an integral part of the government expenditure. At the same time, the authorities should also respect the value of arts which are individually and socially advantageous.
";"The debate over how government funds should be allocated is a long-standing one. While some argue that public services should be the main focus of government spending, others believe that the arts should also be given a share of the budget. This essay will argue that government should spend money on the arts, in addition to public services.
 
 First of all, the arts are an important part of any society. They provide a platform for creativity and expression, and can be a source of inspiration and joy. The arts can also be used to educate and inform, and can help to foster a sense of community and belonging. By investing in the arts, governments can help to ensure that these benefits are available to all citizens.
 
 Secondly, the arts can be a source of economic growth. The creative industries are a major contributor to the global economy, and investment in the arts can help to create jobs and stimulate economic activity. Furthermore, the arts can attract tourists, which can help to boost local economies.
 
 Thirdly, investment in the arts can help to promote social cohesion. The arts can bring people together and help to bridge divides between different social groups. This can help to create a more harmonious society, and can help to reduce social tensions.
 
 Finally, investment in the arts can help to improve the quality of life for citizens. The arts can provide a source of entertainment and relaxation, and can help to reduce stress and anxiety. Furthermore, the arts can help to promote mental health and wellbeing, and can help to improve peoples overall quality of life.
 
 In conclusion, it is clear that government should spend money on the arts, in addition to public services. The arts are an important part of any society, and can provide a range of benefits, both economic and social. Furthermore, investment in the arts can help to improve the quality of life for citizens. For these reasons, governments should ensure that the arts are given a share of the budget.";"The argument that governments should focus spending on public services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure has been an ongoing discussion for years. While this is an important investment that must be made, governments should also make an effort to invest in the arts. Artistic activities provide countless benefits to society and to the communities they inhabit. From a utilitarian perspective, the governments spending on art is an investment in the economic growth and cultural development of society.
 
 First, investing in the arts brings economic growth. Studies have shown that investments in art can have a positive effect on local economies, with benefits ranging from job creation and increased spending power to improvements in the tourist economy and more. Encouraging the arts can also lead to the growth of local businesses due to the influx of tourists and potential buyers of art. Art lovers from all over the world are constantly looking for the latest and greatest artistic creations, and governments should invest in this sector to meet this demand.
 
 Second, investing in the arts provides cultural development. The arts are a powerful tool for self-expression and communicationthey provide individuals with an outlet for emotions, ideas, and stories that are unique to each community. By investing in the arts, governments can provide funding for art events and programs in their communities, allowing them to explore and better understand their own culture, as well as those of others.
 
 Additionally, the arts foster creativity, a skill that is increasingly important in the modern world. Creative people are highly sought after by employers, not just in the arts but in all industries. A government that supports and encourages artistic activities helps its citizens develop the creative skills they need to excel in the workplace.
 
 Finally, governments should invest in the arts because it is beneficial to the overall health and wellbeing of citizens. Art can provide a sense of purpose and joy to people, helping them to cope with stress, anxiety, and depression. Furthermore, art can also act as a bridge between cultures and people, thus creating a kind of understanding and empathy that can help to bring about peace and harmony.
 
 In conclusion, governments should invest in the arts because it brings about economic growth, provides cultural development, fosters creativity, and contributes to the overall health and wellbeing of the population. Art is essential to the cultural identity of any nation, and governments should make an effort to invest in its growth and development.";66;2146;2002;2631;2316.5
79;essay80.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/keeping-animals-zoos-right-wrong-29620/;Keeping animals in zoos;"Since the time they were introduced zoos have both been supported and criticized. Many believe that zoos could be very entertaining and ecologically important, whereas, others think that keeping animals in captivity is totally wrong. Both sides will be discussed before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.
 First, critics of zoology argue that keeping animals in captivity is wrong because animals should be considered non-human persons and they should have the right of having freedom. This is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures. That is because, many zoos, especially the ones in developing countries, do not provide care and attention which their animals require. The animals are often undernourished and do not have sufficient quality and quantity of medical treatment. In addition, sometimes animals from hot countries have to survive in the cold winter of somewhere in Europe.
 On the other hand, the advocators believe that zoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology. Many people, especially young children enjoy going to zoos and see their favorite animals, cute baby-born animals and the animals that are from the different corners of the world. Zoos provide educational information about the lives of different animals to the public. Also, zoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life. This is due to the fact that, in zoos, animals are kept in enclosures which simulate their own habitats and also endangered animals are being protected from their predators or hunters. Thus zoos are needed to keep the nature balanced.
 In conclusion, both of the arguments have strong supports, but in my own view, more good come from zoos than bad. However, it is hoped that the standards of zoos should be leveled up to ensure that the animals in zoos are provided with good care and attention.
";"Animals have been kept in zoos for centuries, and the practice of keeping animals in captivity has been a source of debate for many years. On one hand, zoos provide a safe environment for animals that would otherwise be in danger in the wild. They also provide educational opportunities for people to learn about different species and their habitats. On the other hand, some argue that zoos are cruel and inhumane, and that animals should not be kept in captivity.
 
 The most important factor to consider when debating the issue of keeping animals in zoos is the welfare of the animals. Zoos must provide a safe and healthy environment for the animals, with adequate space, food, and medical care. Zoos must also provide enrichment activities to keep the animals mentally and physically stimulated. If these conditions are not met, then the animals can suffer from boredom, stress, and physical ailments.
 
 In addition to the welfare of the animals, the educational opportunities that zoos provide should also be taken into consideration. Zoos can be a great way for people to learn about different species and their habitats. They can also be a great way to teach children about conservation and the importance of protecting endangered species.
 
 Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to keep animals in zoos should be based on the individual situation. If the animals are provided with a safe and healthy environment, and if the zoo provides educational opportunities, then keeping animals in zoos can be a beneficial practice. However, if the animals are not provided with adequate space, food, and medical care, or if the zoo does not provide educational opportunities, then keeping animals in zoos may not be the best option.";"Zoos have been a part of human history since ancient times and have evolved from primarily utilitarian endeavors, as means of entertainment and as tools for education and conservation. As a result, the role of keeping animals in zoos has been heavily debated for centuries and continues to be controversial today. Proponents of keeping animals in zoos argue that their presence is beneficial both for the animals and for the people who visit and learn from them; however, opponents note that animals in captivity can suffer from psychological and physical ailments due to their restricted environment and lack of autonomy. In this essay, I will analyze both sides of this debate and explore how zoos can balance the needs of the animals with the purpose of providing enjoyment and education to the public.
 
 Those who support the idea of keeping animals in zoos posit that many species are next to impossible to observe in the wild and that it is beneficial to both the animals and the people who view them in captivity. Zoos can provide both a safe and comfortable habitat for endangered species, and can prevent inbreeding, which could potentially lead to genetic mutations. Moreover, it can allow some species to reproduce in order to boost their population, as many are threatened with extinction due to habitat loss and poaching. Keeping animals in zoos can also facilitate research, as zoos provide the ability to closely monitor and study the behavior of animals. Finally, zoos can be an educational experience, providing visitors the opportunity to learn about the biology, behavior, and ecology of various species.
 
 On the other hand, those who disagree with housing animals in zoos point out that animals in captivity are highly restricted, which can lead to physical and psychological issues, such as a lack of exercise and stimulation, as well as boredom and depression. Furthermore, zoos can be overcrowded and animals may not be able to express their natural behaviors due to limited space, potentially leading to stress and aggression. Finally, there is the risk of disease transmission, as animals in close contact with one another are more likely to spread germs. Additionally, some have argued that keeping animals in zoos is inhumane and exploitative, as the animals are reduced to a mere spectacle which humans pay to watch, as opposed to being respected and appreciated as fellow creatures.
 
 Ultimately, it is clear that there are valid pros and cons to the question of whether animals should be kept in zoos. Given this, it is essential for zoos to make the welfare of their animals a priority. This can be done by providing the animals with ample space, engaging activities, and enriched diets to prevent the development of psychological or physical issues. Additionally, zoos should take the initiative to conduct research to better understand the needs of each species, as well as to ensure that the animals are being adequately cared for. By doing this, zoos can ensure that they are providing a safe and stimulating environment for the animals while also providing educational and entertaining experiences for visitors.";23;1978;1738;3151;2444.5
80;essay81.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/essay-freedom-express-ideas-29565/;Artists' freedom to express ideas;"Artists in most countries are given the freedom to express their thoughts in whatever they do. Nevertheless, some argue that there should be government restrictions in order to limit their opinions. I however, agree to this only to a certain extent and believe that the artists must be given freedom so that they will produce some really marvelous masterpiece.
 First and foremost, if there is control over artists' ideas, they will definitely lose their sense of creativity in the long run. It is undeniable that when they are given the opportunity to express themselves, most artists will think out of the box and come up with spectacular Arts such as paintings or movies. For example, paintings by Da Vinci and Michallengo are admired even till now as they were not restricted during those times. In short, without any limitations, there will be more awe inspiring work from our artists.
 Furthermore, it is every human's right to be able to voice out their opinions in any ways as long as they do not cause any problems to the nation. Today, many countries make numerous efforts to show that they are democratic countries. Arts is one of the ways that can be used to criticise social problems and government policies in a particular country. To illustrate this further, the famous movie '3 Idiots' acted by Amir Khan criticises the education system which is chiefly based on memorising and not being able to apply whatever the students learn. Thus, human rights is violated if artists are not allowed to express their feelings freely.
 Looking from another perspective, there are certain drawbacks if artists are not restricted. They might go deeper into certain aspects that can cause controversies in a country. To cite an example, Malaysia is a multiracial country whereby all the citizens live together in harmony and peace. In case there is anyone who brings up some sensitive issues in their films or books regarding any races, this might end up in some chaos among the society. Nonetheless, I believe that artists know their boundaries very well and would surely do not want their names tarnished just because of their unscrupulous acts.
 To conclude, it is now evident that there should not be any restrictions on artists' work. Allowing them to think freely will give them an opportunity to express themselves as ideas can naturally flow when there are no limitations. Hence, even though freedom to express ideas can bring some negative effects, I certainly believe that there are many wonderful and beautiful Arts due to the freedom to express ideas and thus, I strongly believe there should be no restrictions on them.
";"The freedom of expression is a fundamental right of all human beings, and artists are no exception. Artists have the right to express their ideas and opinions through their work, regardless of whether they are popular or controversial. This right is essential to the development of art, as it allows artists to explore new ideas and push boundaries.
 
 The ability to express ideas freely is essential for artists to create meaningful works of art. Without this freedom, artists would be limited to creating works that are socially acceptable and in line with the status quo. This would stifle creativity and prevent artists from exploring new ideas and pushing the boundaries of art.
 
 The freedom of expression also allows artists to challenge existing norms and beliefs. By expressing their ideas through their work, artists can challenge the status quo and encourage people to think differently. This can lead to positive social change, as it encourages people to think critically and question the status quo.
 
 However, freedom of expression is not without its limits. While artists should be allowed to express their ideas freely, they should also be mindful of the potential consequences of their work. For example, if an artist creates a work that is offensive or inflammatory, they may face legal repercussions. Similarly, if an artist creates a work that is deemed to be in bad taste, they may face criticism from the public.
 
 In conclusion, freedom of expression is essential for artists to create meaningful works of art. It allows them to explore new ideas and push boundaries, as well as challenge existing norms and beliefs. However, artists should also be mindful of the potential consequences of their work, as they may face legal or public backlash if their work is deemed to be offensive or in bad taste.";"The freedom to express ones ideas has been acknowledged as a fundamental human right since time immemorial. Similarly, artists must be free to express themselves and their opinions on matters both political and personal. Throughout history, art has always been intertwined with politics and the expression of opinions. From the powerful works of the Renaissance to the emotionally charged works of the Impressionists, the artwork of each time period has been shaped by the philosophies of the age. It is these very works of art, which allow the artist to freely express their ideas on important topics.
 
 In modern times, the freedom of artists to express themselves has come under fire from both governments and conservative organizations. The idea of freedom of expression is being challenged as governments strive to limit the works of controversial or incendiary artists. They often censor, or even ban, certain works of art if they are deemed too controversial or dangerous. Unfortunately, the right of the artist to express his or her ideas is often overshadowed by the fear of the repercussions of the content of their work.
 
 However, despite the attempts of governments and organizations to restrict the works of certain artists, there is still a strong legal protection for the freedom of expression of artists. Most countries have laws in place to protect the ability of artists to express their opinions freely. This is done by protecting the artist from censorship and creating an environment in which art can exist without fear of retribution. In addition, these laws protect the artist from any form of discrimination based on their ideas or works.
 
 The ability of artists to express their ideas freely is an essential component of a free and open society. Artists have the opportunity to push the boundaries of society and to force the public to think about issues differently. Art has the power to spark conversation, create discourse, and to spark political action. It is a medium through which important issues can be discussed and debated without fear of censorship or persecution. 
 
 At the end of the day, the freedom of expression of an artist is a freedom that must be protected. The ability of an artist to express their ideas and opinions on matters of significance is essential to democracy and the progress of a nation. Free expression of ideas is what makes art powerful and captivating, and it is an essential part of the creative process. It is an essential right, and one that the general public should ensure is protected by all means necessary.";33;2634;1827;2583;2205.0
81;essay82.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/advertising-positive-negative-part-lives-29467/;Advertising - positive or negative part of our lives;"Nowadays, the use of advertisement through different forms of media such as newspapers, radio and television has become very prevalent, so it is thought to be a necessary part of today's society. Many believe that advertising has brought great benefits to lives therefore it should be considered a positive activity while others have held a complete different idea about this. Both views will be critiqued before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.
 First, it is generally understood that advertising is carried out with the main purpose of promoting different products and services or encouraging people to consume more. Advertisements are, therefore, very important for many businesses to increase sales and hence profits. Also, to consumers, advertising can bring them many benefits. For example, customers of telecommunication services will have an idea about the current offers of different companies and hence they can compare them and then have a better decision in choosing their internet or mobile phone plans. From all of these, it is easy to see why the idea that advertising is a positive part of life will garner strong support.
 However, it can be seen that some people have argued against advertising due to its negative impacts. Firstly, a huge amount of different advertisements could be sent automatically by a system to personal phones or email addresses, this is generally known as spam, and causes discomfort or even annoyance to many people. Secondly, advertising can be very expensive and not every advertising campaign can be done successfully and brings good results. Therefore, advertising is believed by many, a financial burden to businesses.
 In conclusion, after analyzing the pros and cons of advertising, both of the views have strong support, but it is felt that more good comes from advertising than bad. Thus, the idea that advertising is a positive part of life can be more supported.
";"Advertising is an integral part of our lives. It is a powerful tool used to influence our decisions and shape our opinions. It can be seen everywhere, from television and radio commercials to billboards and online ads. While advertising can be beneficial in some ways, it can also have a negative impact on our lives.
 
 Advertising can be a positive part of our lives in that it can provide us with information about products and services that we may not have known about otherwise. It can also help to create competition in the marketplace, which can lead to lower prices and better quality products. Additionally, advertising can help to create jobs and stimulate the economy.
 
 On the other hand, advertising can have a negative impact on our lives. It can be used to manipulate us into buying products that we dont need or cant afford. It can also be used to create false impressions of products or services, leading us to make decisions that we may later regret. Additionally, advertising can be used to target vulnerable populations, such as children, and exploit their naivety for the purpose of making a profit.
 
 Overall, advertising can be both a positive and negative part of our lives. It can provide us with useful information and help to stimulate the economy, but it can also be used to manipulate us and exploit vulnerable populations. It is important to be aware of the potential risks associated with advertising and to make informed decisions when it comes to our purchases.";"Advertising is a pervasive force in modern life. It influences how people think, how they act and how they view the world around them. It is a form of communication that often involves the use of persuasive messages to sell products or services. Depending on ones perspective, advertising can be seen as either a positive or a negative part of our lives.
 
 From a positive point of view, advertising can be seen as an effective way to convey messages to potential customers. It reaches out to those who are interested in the product or service being promoted, and enables them to make an informed decision. It also provides businesses with the opportunity to reach more potential customers. By providing information to potential customers in an easily digestible form, advertising can help drive up sales and increase profits.
 
 Advertising can also be seen as a positive force in society as a whole. It educates consumers about new products and services and can help them to make more informed choices. It can also help to promote important social causes and bring attention to important issues. For example, advertising campaigns against smoking, alcohol abuse, and driving under the influence have all been successful in raising awareness and changing public opinion.
 
 On the other hand, advertising can also be seen as a negative force in our lives. It can be seen as an invasion of privacy and can be seen as manipulative. There is a strong element of consumerism in advertising, which encourages people to over-consume and buy products they do not need. It also puts pressure on people to conform to certain standards of beauty and success, which may be damaging to some audiences.
 
 Overall, advertising can be seen as both a positive and a negative part of our lives. It has the potential to educate and inform, as well as to manipulate and pressure people into buying things they do not need. The power of advertising lies in its ability to reach out to consumers and influence their decisions, and this power should be used responsibly.";52;1919;1496;2051;1773.5
82;essay83.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/the-nuclear-power-provide-clean-cheap-energy-29457/;The nuclear power provide clean and cheap energy;"The topic of nuclear technology frequently generates a heated debate with proponenets maintaining that nuclear power provides a source of efficient and economical energy while opponents argue that atomic technology is uncontrollable and very dangerous to handle. As far as my opinion is concerned , I find myself aligned with opponenets of the usages of nuclear power. I have several reasons to believe its disadvantages outnumber the few advantages.
 First and foremost reason is that pursuit of nuclear technology one way or the other leads towards atomic weapons. Last centuary has witnesed the horrors of such weapons. If each country pursues the fusion and fission process some of them may try to mold it for millitary usage.
 Another reason to fortify my opinion is that even civil usages of atomic power pose a dire threat of radio activity. For example recently there has been an incident in which an atomic power house leaked tons of radio active material into air when an earthquake hit the surrounding area. This unfortunate event proves that no matter how much careful we are such accidents are unevitable.
 Last but not least, while generating energy from any source be it hydro power or oil there always is some wastage and so is the case with nuclear power. Safely getting rid of nuclear waste is a daunting task and there has not been any permanat solution of it. This waste is many times more lethal to our environment than any of the other hazordous material.
 To sum it up, from above mentioned facts it can easily be deduced that nuclear power may apear silver bullet for energy crisis but its disadvantages far outweigh the adavantages. Thus i suggest that use of nuclear technology should be discouraged even for civil purposes.
";"The nuclear power has been a controversial topic for many years. It is a form of energy that has the potential to provide clean and cheap energy to the world, but it also has the potential to cause great destruction. This essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of nuclear power, and how it can provide clean and cheap energy.
 
 The main advantage of nuclear power is that it is a clean and cheap form of energy. Nuclear power plants do not produce any greenhouse gases, and they are much more efficient than traditional forms of energy production. This means that nuclear power plants can produce more energy for less money, making it a cost-effective option for many countries. Additionally, nuclear power plants are relatively safe, and they can be built quickly and easily.
 
 However, there are also some disadvantages to nuclear power. One of the main concerns is the risk of nuclear accidents. Although nuclear power plants are designed to be safe, accidents can still occur, and they can have devastating consequences. Additionally, nuclear waste is a major problem, as it is difficult and expensive to store and dispose of safely. Finally, nuclear power plants require a large amount of water for cooling, which can be a problem in areas with limited water resources.
 
 Despite the potential risks, nuclear power can still provide clean and cheap energy. Nuclear power plants are much more efficient than traditional forms of energy production, and they do not produce any greenhouse gases. Additionally, nuclear power plants can be built quickly and easily, and they can provide a reliable source of energy for many countries.
 
 In conclusion, nuclear power can provide clean and cheap energy, but it also has some potential risks. It is important to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of nuclear power before making any decisions. However, if done correctly, nuclear power can be a safe and cost-effective way to provide energy to the world.";"Nuclear power has long been regarded as a reliable source of clean and cheap energy. It provides a long-term, stable energy source that can be generated in even the most remote locations. Unlike other forms of energy, nuclear power does not rely on finite resources like coal and oil, meaning it can be harnessed without exhausting natural resources. This is why it is often seen as a sustainable and renewable form of energy.
 
 Nuclear power plants convert uranium into heat, which is then transformed into electricity for use in homes and businesses. Compared to other forms of energy production, nuclear power is incredibly efficient, producing about 20 times more electricity for each unit of fossil fuel than coal. This means that nuclear power can provide clean, cheap, and plentiful electricity in places where other sources may be unreliable or too expensive. Moreover, nuclear power plants can operate around the clock, ensuring a steady and reliable source of energy.
 
 The environmental advantages of nuclear power are also clear. Unlike energy sources such as coal, it emits no greenhouse gases or toxins into the air. This means that nuclear power can help reduce air pollution and mitigate climate change. Additionally, newer and safer methods of uranium enrichment and waste disposal have significantly reduced risks associated with nuclear power.
 
 Overall, nuclear power has a great deal to offer in terms of providing clean and cheap energy. It is an efficient and reliable source of energy that can be used to power homes and businesses. It also emits no greenhouse gases or pollutants and is a sustainable, renewable source of energy. As such, nuclear power is an ideal choice for countries and communities around the world looking for an affordable and clean way to meet their energy needs.";48;1751;1971;1814;1892.5
83;essay84.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/giving-mobile-phones-unemployed-essay-29393/;Giving mobile phones to the unemployed;"Today, the rate of unemployment is on the rise and is seriously being debated by many. Some opine that the best method to minimize this problem is by providing the unemployed with hand phones that have access to the Internet. They also believe that this solution is the most appropriate way to utilize the public money. Nevertheless, I agree to this solution only to a certain degree because I feel that giving those with no work a mobile phone each is a total waste of money.
 In a positive point of view, when people without jobs have hand phones that have access to the Internet, they will be able to browse the net for more job opportunities. For example, they can surf the The Star Onlines' work section to find a job that is suitable for them. With the help of the net, they can also do more research on the work that they have found apart from looking up on how they can prepare themselves for the job. Not only that, the mobile phones can also be used to make calls with the companies in which they would like to work with. In short, if the government provides those without work with a mobile phone, they will be able to find themselves an occupation in order to live and survive.
 Nonetheless, looking from another perspective, supplying hand phones to the unemployed is a waste of the taxpayers' money. This is because the money instead of being used to supply the electronic gadget can be used for other useful purposes for the country. To illustrate this further, the money can be used to build more amenities for the public or given to the poor so that they can use it to help them earn a living. To conclude, the money can be used for other intentions rather than giving hand phones to the unemployed.
 Furthermore, when hand phones are provided for free, many would want to take advantage of this opportunity. It will not be surprising that in order to obtain a mobile phone, they make themselves jobless. Some might even go to the extent of lying that they are on unemployment to make them eligible to get the phones. In this context, the public's money is spent worthlessly. On top of that, till now, there are no surveys or evidences that prove this method in effective in reducing the rate of unemployment.
 To put it in a nutshell, the suggestion of providing those who are jobless with mobile phones that are accessible to internet is not a proper and the best way to trim down the rate of unemployment. I suggest the government look into the background of the people in depth before giving out hand phones to them. I strongly believe that the public money should be utilized for the benefit of the society and not just for some of them who are not willing to put in more effort to find them a proper work.
";"The issue of giving mobile phones to the unemployed is a controversial one. On the one hand, some argue that it is a waste of money and resources, while others believe that it could be beneficial to those who are out of work. In this essay, I will explore both sides of the argument and ultimately argue that giving mobile phones to the unemployed could be beneficial in certain circumstances.
 
 The primary argument against giving mobile phones to the unemployed is that it is a waste of money and resources. This argument is based on the idea that the unemployed are not able to afford mobile phones and that the money used to purchase them could be better spent elsewhere. Furthermore, it is argued that the unemployed are not likely to use the phones for anything other than leisure activities, such as playing games or watching videos.
 
 On the other hand, there are those who argue that giving mobile phones to the unemployed could be beneficial in certain circumstances. For example, it could help them stay connected with potential employers, allowing them to apply for jobs more easily. Additionally, it could help them stay in touch with family and friends, which could be beneficial for their mental health. Finally, it could provide them with access to online resources, such as job search websites and career advice.
 
 Ultimately, I believe that giving mobile phones to the unemployed could be beneficial in certain circumstances. For example, if the phones are used for job search purposes, then it could be a worthwhile investment. Additionally, if the phones are used to stay connected with family and friends, then it could be beneficial for their mental health. However, it is important to note that the phones should not be used for leisure activities, as this would be a waste of money and resources.
 
 In conclusion, the issue of giving mobile phones to the unemployed is a controversial one. While some argue that it is a waste of money and resources, others believe that it could be beneficial in certain circumstances. Ultimately, I believe that giving mobile phones to the unemployed could be beneficial in certain circumstances, such as for job search purposes or for staying connected with family and friends.";"With the rise of technology, mobile phones have become an essential part of life. Many people rely on them for various activities such as communication, work, business, entertainment, online shopping and so on. For the unemployed, giving mobile phones can be beneficial in a variety of ways.
 
 For one, mobile phones can be used to aid in getting a job. For example, many job search platforms can be accessed via mobile devices, allowing job seekers to easily search and apply for job openings. Furthermore, modern job search sites, such as Linked In, even allow job seekers to connect directly with prospective employers. This makes it easier for unemployed individuals to network and improve their chances of finding relevant job opportunities.
 
 Moreover, mobile phones can be used as a tool for learning new skills. There are numerous educational applications available for download, which can be used for free or for a minimal cost. These platforms contain a plethora of information which can be used to gain knowledge in any field. It is especially beneficial for an unemployed person who is looking to improve their skillset, as it allows them to gain expertise without funding.
 
 Additionally, mobile phones can be used to stay connected socially, even during periods of unemployment. This is especially important considering the pandemic, as it helps to reduce feelings of isolation and depression. Additionally, connecting with other job seekers can be beneficial as well, as they may be able to provide advice and resources in the search for employment.
 
 Finally, mobile phones can be used as a tool of motivation. Many motivational apps exist which offer advice and guidance for those looking for job opportunities. They can help to provide inspiration for the unemployed, and can help them to stay focused and positive during their journey of finding a job.
 
 Overall, it is clear that giving mobile phones to the unemployed can be beneficial in many ways. From providing access to job search sites, helping to learn new skills, connecting with potential employers and aiding in motivation, these devices can be incredibly helpful for those looking for employment.";38;2729;2240;2183;2211.5
84;essay85.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/use-cctv-cameras-essay-29373/;Use of CCTV cameras;"Today, close circuit television (CCTV) cameras are widely used in a variety of circumstances. They are used in schools, businesses and some other premises in order to monitor the activities taking place. It is undeniable that the use of CCTV has plenty of benefits to offer, especially in reducing crimes and protecting the employees in a premise. Nevertheless, some argue that these cameras invade their privacies due to constantly being monitored. Even so, I strongly believe that CCTV cameras should be installed in every premise to combat the ever increasing theft rate and to protect the workers at the workplace.
 Firstly, by having CCTV cameras at workplace, crimes such as robbery can be trimmed down. This is because when a shop is attacked by thieves, the clips taken by these cameras serve as a source of evidence to help the thieves to be traced. To illustrate this further, in Malaysia, policemen used the videos captured by the CCTV cameras to trace and successfully catch a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop during the midnight. Not only that, as the employees know that they are under constant surveillance, they will less likely steal from the shops. Thus, it is clear that CCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized.
 Furthermore, at some offices, employees are often required to handle angry or frustrated customers. At times, face-to-face interactions with an annoyed customer can put the employee in physical danger. Hence, the installation of CCTV cameras may help the employees escape this situation because the customers know very well that their conversations are recorded. In the event of an argument, the videotapes can used to determine what actually took place and further actions can be then taken. In short, these cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers.
 Looking from another perspective, the use of CCTV cameras does cause controversy. Those opposing the CCTV systems feel that their privacies are invaded with the constant monitoring of the cameras. However, one must realize that safety is of paramount importance compared to privacy and prevention is always better than suffering from the consequences. Ergo, opponents of this system should try to comprehend the situation and take actions to prevent themselves from being victims of crime.
 To conclude, CCTV cameras are essential and therefore must be installed in every premise. This is chiefly to shield oneself from being harmed by any intruders or robbers. Admittedly, privacies are lost with the use of these cameras. Nonetheless, safety should be put first in order to be safe.
";"The use of CCTV cameras has become increasingly popular in recent years, with many businesses, organizations, and even individuals installing them for security and surveillance purposes. CCTV cameras are used to monitor public areas, such as streets, parks, and shopping centers, as well as private areas, such as homes and businesses. They can be used to deter crime, identify suspects, and provide evidence in criminal investigations.
 
 The use of CCTV cameras has been controversial, with some arguing that they are an invasion of privacy and a violation of civil liberties. However, there are also many benefits to using CCTV cameras. For example, they can help to reduce crime and increase public safety. CCTV cameras can also be used to monitor traffic and provide evidence in traffic accidents. Additionally, CCTV cameras can be used to monitor employee activity in businesses, helping to ensure that employees are following company policies and regulations.
 
 The use of CCTV cameras can also be beneficial in providing evidence in criminal investigations. CCTV footage can be used to identify suspects and provide evidence in court. Additionally, CCTV cameras can be used to monitor public areas and help to deter crime.
 
 Despite the benefits of using CCTV cameras, there are also some drawbacks. For example, CCTV cameras can be expensive to install and maintain. Additionally, there are privacy concerns associated with the use of CCTV cameras, as they can be used to monitor individuals without their knowledge or consent.
 
 Overall, the use of CCTV cameras can be beneficial in providing security and surveillance, as well as providing evidence in criminal investigations. However, there are also some drawbacks associated with the use of CCTV cameras, such as privacy concerns and the cost of installation and maintenance. Therefore, it is important to consider the pros and cons of using CCTV cameras before making a decision.";"Introduction 
 
 The use of Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras has become increasingly widespread in recent years. CCTV cameras have been used for a variety of purposes, ranging from security to public safety, and there are a number of benefits associated with the use of CCTV cameras. This essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the use of CCTV cameras, considering both the positives and the potential negative impacts of their use.
 
 Advantages of CCTV Cameras
 
 One of the main advantages of CCTV cameras is that they can be used to improve public safety. CCTV cameras can help to deter crime, as they can act as a visible reminder that someone is watching and that criminal activity may not go unnoticed. This can provide an additional layer of security for both citizens and businesses. CCTV cameras can also be used to assist police in apprehending criminals, as they can provide evidence that can be used to identify suspects and aid in the prosecution of those responsible.
 
 Another benefit of CCTV cameras is that they can be used to monitor traffic and traffic patterns, helping to reduce congestion on roads. By monitoring traffic, CCTV cameras can help authorities to identify problem areas and ensure that traffic laws are being adhered to. This can lead to an improvement in public safety, as well as reducing the time and expense associated with traffic violations.
 
 Finally, CCTV cameras can be used to monitor activities in public areas, such as parks and public squares. This can be especially useful in helping to prevent anti-social behaviour, such as vandalism and harassment, as well as aiding the police if such activities do take place.
 
 Disadvantages of CCTV Cameras
 
 The use of CCTV cameras does have some potential drawbacks. The first of these is that CCTV cameras can potentially infringe on an individual's right to privacy. By installing CCTV cameras, authorities can potentially gain access to a person's private life, and this can be seen as an invasion of privacy.
 
 Another potential drawback is cost. Installing and maintaining a CCTV system can be a costly process and many people may be unwilling to invest in such a system due to the associated costs.
 
 Conclusion
 
 In conclusion, while CCTV cameras can offer many benefits, they can also present some potential drawbacks. When considering the use of CCTV cameras, it is important to consider both the positive and the negative impacts of such a system. It is also important to ensure that any CCTV system installed is done so in a way that respects an individual's right to privacy.";19;2668;1946;2609;2277.5
85;essay86.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/undergraduate-essays-2/teaching-researching-working-together-lead-success-writing-30213/;teaching and researching working together lead to the success;"Recently, the controversial debate surrounding universities has sparked interests among students and the media. Some of them deem universities principally provide training for people to be qualified employees. However, others support that it is more reasonable to set down universities as a centre of culture life where knowledge is transferred and updated. This essay will argue that the main functions of universities as the highest educational institution are teaching and researching.
 Firstly, imparting knowledge and educating people are basic duty of universities where people decide career direction and acquire more specialized knowledge and skills. Systematic and comprehensive training programs in specific fields urge people to master information required quickly and thoroughly. Nevertheless, universities are not only continuation of schooling but a platform where people start knowing more about society. The essential social capabilities such as communication skills, teamwork, leadership and time management are gradually cultivated with group workshops and various kinds of social activities in universities.
 Secondly, universities playing the most important role in education system have to guarantee the knowledge conveyed is true and useful, which can be achieved through the researching function. Old knowledge is applied to particular problems during research and solutions found often bring about innovations in culture and technology to promote human and communities to step forward.
 In conclusion, it can be seen that universities produce a great many of talents with outstanding teaching and advance the progress of human society with achievements in scientific research. Both teaching and researching working together lead to the success of today's universities.

86;essay87.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/can-petrol-price-increase-impact-reducing-traffic-pollution-30195/;Can petrol price increase impact on reducing traffic and pollution?;"Nowadays, the importance of vehicles has been widely recognized thoughout the world. However, it rises concerns about the increasingly severe traffic problems as well as the automobile exhaust pollution. Some argue that the best solution to these issues is raising the price of petrol. From my perspective, I think their view is overly simplistic.
 Undeniably, making the fuel cost more money could limit the number of vehicles to some extent. Due to the increasing number of petrol stations, the competition in this field is more and more fierce, thus the price of petrol could be lower in the future. Therefore, those who are suffering from the inefficiency of public transport tend to own a car immediately. Moreover, some families purchase even more than three cars just for their own sake. In such case if they must pay more money on fuel, they may consider about that price of purchasing additionally for more time.
 Nevertheless, such an argument may restrict the real necessity of automobiles. In fact, some families really need one or two cars. For example, three family members have to work or study in three place separated so far with each other, then they need to acquire at least two cars or they may both be late. On the other hand, the development of automobile industry could be restrained as well as the employments offered by it, which could have negative effects on economy. Therefore, I can hardly agree that the solution is the best.
 From my mind, I think there are three ways tosolve these problems. Firstly, a new method of expenditure classification could be adopted. For instance, individuals had to pay much more for fuel if they possess more than three vehicles; secondly, the government should develop the public transport to meet the residents' demand; last but not least, the people should be encouraged to use electric car to reduce the car emissions.
 To conclude, I personally believe the government should take some actions such as classifying the payment, boosting the public transport and encouraging individuals to adopt the zero-emission cars, rather than raising the price of petrol, to get rid of the traffic and pollution problems.
";"The increasing cost of petrol has been a major concern for many people, especially those who rely on it to get to work or school. With the rising cost of petrol, it is becoming more difficult for people to afford to drive their cars. This has led to an increase in traffic and pollution in many cities around the world.
 
 The impact of petrol price increases on traffic and pollution is twofold. Firstly, it reduces the number of people who are able to afford to drive their cars. This means that fewer cars are on the roads, leading to less traffic and pollution. Secondly, it encourages people to use public transport or other forms of transport such as cycling or walking. This reduces the number of cars on the roads and therefore reduces the amount of traffic and pollution.
 
 In order to reduce traffic and pollution, governments should consider increasing the price of petrol. This will encourage people to use public transport or other forms of transport, which will reduce the number of cars on the roads and therefore reduce the amount of traffic and pollution. Additionally, governments should also consider providing incentives for people to switch to more environmentally friendly forms of transport such as electric cars. This will reduce the amount of pollution caused by petrol-powered cars and will also reduce the amount of traffic on the roads.
 
 In conclusion, petrol price increases can have a significant impact on reducing traffic and pollution. By encouraging people to use public transport or other forms of transport, and providing incentives for people to switch to more environmentally friendly forms of transport, governments can reduce the amount of traffic and pollution on the roads. This will benefit both the environment and the people who rely on petrol to get to work or school.";"When it comes to reducing traffic and pollution, increasing petrol prices can have an impact. This is because high petrol prices can be a strong incentive for consumers to use their vehicles less often and utilize other forms of transportation that are more environmentally friendly. 
 
 The most obvious way that petrol prices can affect traffic and pollution is through a decrease in vehicle use. This is because when petrol prices are increased, consumers will be less likely to use their vehicles for errands or social activities due to the high price of fuel. As a result, fewer vehicles will be clogging up roads, leading to a decrease in traffic. Additionally, fewer vehicles on the road will lead to less air pollution, which can help to improve air quality. 
 
 In addition to reducing traffic, higher petrol prices can also encourage people to use alternative forms of transportation such as public transit, bike riding, or car-sharing. All of these transport modes are more energy efficient than using a personal vehicle, resulting in fewer emissions being released. Public transit, in particular, can be an effective way of reducing both traffic and pollution since it allows large volumes of people to be transported in one vehicle. This reduces the number of vehicles on the road and helps to cut down on emissions. 
 
 Although increasing petrol prices can have a positive environmental impact, it is important to note that the economic effects must also be considered. High petrol prices can have a negative financial effects on low income households who may struggle to pay for petrol. In addition, higher petrol prices can lead to an increase in the cost of goods and services due to the increased cost of transportation. 
 
 Overall, increasing petrol prices can have an impact on reducing traffic and pollution, but it is important to recognize that there must be an equitable solution that does not unfairly burden low income households. To achieve the greatest reduction in traffic and pollution, efforts should be made to encourage the use of public transportation and other alternative forms of transportation.";67;2175;1817;2134;1975.5
87;essay88.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/topic-some-people-prefer-live-small-town-30079/;Prefer to live in a small town rather than a city;"Many people believe that the life in a major metropolis is convenient and interesting. Personally, however, I am in favor of living in a small town. The atmosphere in suburban area brings me peaceful feeling. Moreover, people there are very friendly. Finally, the environmental is greener than in cities. That is why I love enjoying my life in a small town.
 First and foremost, peaceful atmosphere is attractive. It is clearly seen that people in large cities face annoying noise and dirty air emitted from vehicles almost everyday. This is likely to adversely affect their mental health. Meanwhile, lives small towns are great deal more quiet and the air is always fresh. These features make a suburban town the paradise for people who want to escape from suffocating lives in major cities.
 Secondly, people in small towns are always friendly. In my experience, many people in urban areas even do not know the names of their neighbors. It is contrary in small town life, where people are ready to help whenever their neighbors are in need. The relationship among them can be so close that they usually attend the birthday party of one of their neighboring people. The affection from people around brings me cozy feeling on my birthday when I live away from my family.
 Finally, the green environment in small towns interests me. It seems to me that there are more trees and lakes in towns than in cities. It is wonderful that I get up early in the morning and take a walk in such a green place. The urban environment, however, is so artificial with only buildings and vehicles. I can not adapt myself to such an environment.
 In conclusion, I would concede that city life has its own advantages. Nonetheless, peaceful atmosphere, friendliness of people, and green landscape strongly convince me that a small town is the best place for me to live in. I love the life in my town.
 
";"Living in a small town rather than a city has its advantages and disadvantages. However, many people prefer to live in a small town for a variety of reasons.
 
 One of the main reasons why people prefer to live in a small town is the sense of community. In a small town, people know each other and look out for one another. This creates a sense of security and belonging that is often lacking in larger cities. Additionally, in a small town, people are more likely to be involved in their community and take part in local events. This can lead to a greater sense of pride and connection to the town.
 
 Another reason why people prefer to live in a small town is the slower pace of life. In a small town, life is less hectic and people have more time to relax and enjoy their surroundings. Additionally, the cost of living is often lower in small towns than in larger cities, making it easier for people to afford the necessities of life.
 
 Finally, small towns often have a unique charm and character that is lacking in larger cities. Small towns often have a rich history and culture that is unique to the area. This can be a great source of pride for the people who live there and can make living in a small town a truly special experience.
 
 In conclusion, living in a small town rather than a city has its advantages and disadvantages. However, many people prefer to live in a small town for the sense of community, slower pace of life, and unique charm and character.";"Living in a small town rather than a city is arguably a more attractive option for many people. Small towns have a certain charm that big cities lack - they are quieter, less crowded, and generally have a slower pace of life. As a result, people might prefer to live in a small town for a number of reasons.
 
 First, small towns often offer a greater sense of community and togetherness than big cities. With less people living in a small town, it is much easier to get to know the people in the town and become involved in their daily lives. Furthermore, because there are less people in small towns, more opportunities for social interaction arise, such as attending town-wide events or having more chances to volunteer in the community.
 
 Second, living in a small town means being able to access nature more easily. While cities often feature parks and other green spaces, these areas are far more abundant in small towns. Also, the air in small towns tends to be much cleaner and fresher than the air in cities, which is especially beneficial for people who struggle with respiratory illnesses or allergies.
 
 Third, small towns are usually less expensive to live in than cities. With less people, there is less demand for housing and other services. Thus, prices are often cheaper in small towns, particularly in terms of rent. This can be especially helpful for people on a tight budget.
 
 Finally, living in a small town often allows people to experience a sense of peace and tranquility. With less traffic, fewer people, and a slower pace of life, it is often much easier to relax and enjoy a tranquil life. This is especially beneficial for those who prefer a simpler and more laid-back lifestyle.
 
 Overall, there are many advantages to living in a small town rather than a city. The sense of community and togetherness, opportunities to experience nature, cost savings, and a more peaceful lifestyle are all reasons why people might prefer to live in a small town.";49;1883;1475;1981;1728.0
88;essay89.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/topic-not-everything-learned-contained-books-29921/;Knowledge from experience is more important than that from books;"The differences between knowledge from books and from experience have erupted endless controversy. Various ideas and preferences have been presented. The purpose of my writing is to deeply discuss these sources of knowledge in two important aspects: accuracy and practicability, and to show my greater interest in knowledge accumulated from experience.
 First and foremost, the accuracy of knowledge is crucially important. It is apparent that books are often written by professors, experts, or authorities in a variety of fields. Therefore, knowledge acquired from books is greatly accepted, which means that it is right to the bulk of people. Meanwhile, knowledge from experience seems a little different from information contained in books. To cite an example, it is common in books that water boils at 100 Celcius degree. However, the result is not always the same in reality because it also depends on the height, the purity of the water, and even the measuring tool. By and large, each source of knowledge has its own accuracy rate.
 Next, the practicability is one of the most essential factors of knowledge. In my experience, information contained in books is usually put in criteria so that many people can read and understand the content. Consequently, it is difficult to apply knowledge from books into practice. Whereas, it is easy to put knowledge from experience in real life because it is acquired from what have happened to them. For instance, a student decides to learn about chemical reactions from books. This method is likely to be fast, simple, and even safe. Nevertheless, there is an increased likelihood that he neither remembers the necessary information for a long time nor knows how to do an make an experiment. Meanwhile, if he goes to the library and carries out the reactions, he is certain to have a thorough grasp of the phenomena seen. He is also able to use this information for the next times. Indeed, knowledge from experience helps people more than knowledge from books does.
 In conclusion, I would concede that knowledge from books is widely accepted. However, I consider knowledge from experience as the more important source because of its negative impacts on real life. Experiencing a thing and drawing information from it is really interesting and helpful.
";"Knowledge from experience is more important than that from books. This is a statement that has been debated for centuries, and it is one that still holds true today. While books can provide a wealth of information, it is the knowledge gained from experience that is truly invaluable.
 
 Experience is the best teacher, and it is through experience that we learn the most. We can read about a concept or idea in a book, but it is only through experiencing it that we truly understand it. For example, a person can read about the process of baking a cake in a book, but it is only through actually baking the cake that they can understand the nuances of the process. This is because experience allows us to gain a deeper understanding of the concept, as we are able to apply it to a real-world situation.
 
 Experience also allows us to gain a better understanding of the consequences of our actions. When we read about a concept in a book, we may not be able to fully understand the implications of our actions. However, when we experience it, we can see the results of our actions and learn from them. This allows us to make better decisions in the future, as we are able to learn from our mistakes.
 
 Finally, knowledge gained from experience is more valuable because it is more personal. When we read about a concept in a book, it is often presented in a generic way that may not be applicable to our own lives. However, when we experience it, we can tailor the knowledge to our own needs and use it to our advantage.
 
 In conclusion, knowledge from experience is more important than that from books. While books can provide a wealth of information, it is the knowledge gained from experience that is truly invaluable. Experience allows us to gain a deeper understanding of a concept, to learn from the consequences of our actions, and to tailor the knowledge to our own needs. For these reasons, knowledge from experience is more valuable than that from books.";"Knowledge from experience is more important than that from books. This is a statement that has been around since the dawn of human thought, and it remains true today. To put it simply, knowledge that comes from experience is far more valuable than that which is gleaned from books. 
 
 To begin with, knowledge that comes from experience has a much deeper understanding than knowledge from books. Many times, knowledge obtained from books is too scientific or theoretical. It can be hard to understand, and even harder to apply to everyday situations. On the other hand, knowledge from experience allows the student to truly understand and integrate the material in a way that books cannot. Experiencing and trying something can give an individual a much better understanding than simply reading about it. 
 
 Also, knowledge from experience often helps to build problem solving and critical thinking skills. Many times, books will only tell you what to do, or how to do something. However, when knowledge is obtained through experience, the student can learn how that information applies in real world situations. This helps to develop problem solving skills, as the student will be forced to analyze the situation and apply their knowledge to achieve a desired outcome. 
 
 Finally, knowledge from experience can be more memorable. When knowledge is acquired by reading, it can be hard to remember the material and utilize it in the future. On the other hand, when knowledge is acquired through experience, it is easier to remember and integrate the information, as one can recall the experience, and the emotions associated with it.
 
 To summarize, knowledge from experience is far more valuable than knowledge from books. It allows for a deeper understanding of the material, helps to develop problem solving and critical thinking skills, and is more memorable. For these reasons, knowledge from experience should be highly valued.";64;2300;1965;1936;1950.5
89;essay90.txt;http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/solve-traffic-housing-problems-moving-companies-rural-areas-29919/;Solve traffic and housing problems by moving companies to the rural areas?;"With the booming development of some cosmopolitan metropolises in recent years, an increasing number of people are flooding into these major cities, raising such urban problems as traffic jams or housing shortage. In such cases, some people think an effective way to tackle these problems is to relocate big firms, factories and their employees in cities to the countryside. However, from my perspective, I suppose this suggestion is not advisable, for it cannot alter the situation essentially and instead it may give rise to new concerns in rural areas.
 Admittedly, moving big companies, factories and their employees to the rural area can help ease traffic congestion and housing scarcity. As people work in the countryside, they will not have to commute in cities at peak times such as eight o'clock in the morning or six o'clock in the afternoon. Consequently, urban traffic jam can be, to some extent, relieved in this respect. On the other hand, the relocation of companies and factories in cities may leave more space to build new residential areas, thus alleviating the urban housing crisis at present.
 However, the proposed measure is not fundamental to resolve urban traffic and housing problems. This is because some employees are reluctant to live in the rural areas only due to the relocation of their workplaces. This can be best illustrated with the example of the married workers. Taking into the growth of their children into consideration, the married workers may believe the educational resources in cities are far superior to ones in the countryside, and because of this, they probably opt for living in the cities. Thus, these employers have to commute between the cities and the countryside, which is ineffective in tackling traffic and housing problems. What is worse, the workers have to consume more time and traffic fees.
 Also, the suggested step can bring about environmental problems in the rural areas. As companies and factories move to the countryside, they may deplete the local natural resources as the raw materials for production. Besides, the untreated pollutants the plants discharge can be damaging to the rural environment .Therefore, moving companies, factories and employees to the rural areas can ruin the environment there.
 Overall, I would conclude that relocating big firms, factories and their employees is not sensible to address urban traffic and housing problems. Instead, the government should be forward-looking, resolving the problems within the cities.
";"The world is becoming increasingly urbanized, with more and more people living in cities. This has led to a number of problems, including traffic congestion and a lack of affordable housing. One potential solution to these problems is to move companies to rural areas. This would reduce the number of people living in cities, thus reducing traffic and easing the strain on housing.
 
 The first step in this process would be to incentivize companies to move to rural areas. This could be done through tax breaks, grants, or other forms of financial assistance. Additionally, the government could provide infrastructure support, such as roads, utilities, and internet access. This would make it easier for companies to set up shop in rural areas.
 
 Once companies have been moved to rural areas, the next step would be to create jobs for the local population. This could be done by providing training and education programs to teach people the skills needed to work in the new companies. Additionally, the government could provide incentives for companies to hire local people. This would help to ensure that the benefits of the move are felt by the local population.
 
 Finally, the government could provide housing assistance to those who move to rural areas to work in the new companies. This could include subsidies for rent or mortgages, as well as assistance with the cost of moving. This would help to ensure that people are able to afford to live in the area.
 
 In conclusion, moving companies to rural areas is a potential solution to traffic and housing problems in cities. This could be done by providing incentives for companies to move, creating jobs for the local population, and providing housing assistance. If implemented properly, this could help to reduce traffic and make housing more affordable.";"The world today faces a multitude of complex and interconnected problems, from air pollution to poverty. Two of the most pressing issues relate to traffic and housing: congested roads, long commutes, overcrowding, and sky-high prices in urban centers. To address these problems, one solution is to move companies to rural areas. Such a move would help to alleviate problems such as traffic congestion, overcrowding in cities, and housing shortages.
 
 In order to reduce traffic congestion, more people need to be encouraged to opt for public transportation and walking or cycling rather than driving. By moving companies to rural areas, the need for people to commute long distances to their job every day is eliminated, thus mitigating traffic congestion. Additionally, as more jobs become available in rural areas, more of the population would be encouraged to move out of large cities and into the more rural, less crowded areas. This could decrease overcrowding in cities, reduce the amount of air pollution, and provide more housing options for those who cant afford the high housing costs of cities, thus helping to reduce the housing crisis.
 
 Moving companies to rural areas can also have further economic benefits. It can bring capital investment and bring opportunities to smaller, rural towns. More businesses in rural areas can bring innovation and new industries as well as create job opportunities that can help boost the local economy. Also, it can increase local tax revenues, thus improving the quality of infrastructure, education, and healthcare, as well as providing other important services that can benefit the local communities.
 
 Finally, it is important to consider the social and cultural benefits of moving companies to rural areas. This could create a more diverse and vibrant community and bring a sense of renewal to a rural town. Moreover, it can help to preserve the culture and traditions of a rural region, as well as provide more opportunities for those who live in rural areas to access the same level of economic and educational opportunities as those living in cities.
 
 In conclusion, moving companies to rural areas is a viable solution to the problems of traffic and housing. It can reduce traffic congestion, overcrowding, and the housing crisis, while also creating economic, cultural, and social benefits for rural communities. Therefore, it is essential that this issue is given greater attention by government and communities if we are to create a better future for everyone.";74;2511;1817;2525;2171.0
